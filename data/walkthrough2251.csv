He had two truths and a lie for an opener, a round robin of vocabulary words for content. He also had some practice problems that were covered in class. The closer was some announcements and reminders about the class. ","SIL showed me the marketing emails he has been sending to the class. I suggested adding memes to make the emails more engaging and incorporating color to encourage students to read them. We also discussed making another class announcement and writing the SI session times on the board to grab students’ attention. He has submitted marketing materials for stickers and candy, which shows he is putting in strong effort to attract students. He also had the room set up in a large rectangle, similar to the layout at training."

Jingsong also used effective redirecting questions and allowed good wait time for students to think. ","Always write the agenda on the board! Students appreciate seeing the session plan on the board, as it helps them know how the session is structured and what to expect. It also seemed like there wasn’t much collaboration, since everyone was on their own laptops coding. I know coding can make group work challenging, but I suggest trying activities on the board or having students work together on the same laptop could help encourage more collaboration. You could also project code on the board and have the students work from there. ",,,,

She started with the opener “connections,” where students paired up and found six things they had in common. This was a strong choice because it helped students feel comfortable and created a welcoming environment. I love how you did a warm-up of dimensional problems to ease the students into the content.","One area for improvement is building more personal connections with students. In the first few minutes before the session begins, try chatting with them about their week or weekend. This helps students feel welcomed and encourages them to come back. Also, don’t be afraid to project your voice more and show confidence. Speaking with more energy and confidence will also make the session feel even more engaging!

For the dimensional analysis warm-up, students weren’t collaborating much. To increase interaction, you might try a “think-pair-share” activity with partners or write parts (a, b, c, d) on the whiteboard and have students come up to solve them. This way, students will be more engaged and talking through the problems together. You could also assign each student one problem, and then have them explain how they did it to the group.",,,,

","She should work on preparedness pretty significantly; some students arrived before she did, she got the room number wrong, and she did not write the agenda or anything on the board even once she did get in the right room. Additionally, it felt like a TA session; all the students were working in quiet apart from one another, and there was no opener or closer. ","I am hesitant to call it a yellow flag, because it's not as though any students were made uncomfortable or anything, but the session did not really feel like SI at all.

One of the first things I heard Emma say was ""SI is the place to make mistakes!"" I always said this in sessions because it's true - SI absolutely is the place to make mistakes (better in session than on an exam) and I'm really glad she's telling the students that. On one of SIL's problems, there was a small mistake and the students pointed it out - I'm not sure if this mistake was intentional or not, but regardless it was a great way to check for understanding, and to make sure that the students are keeping up. 

SIL also checked for understanding using the thumbs method, which is great. She also really did well with redirection questions, asking the students to explain how they worked through the problem and encouraging them to redo old problems in order to practice this topic. Already encouraging students off the bat to go back to previous SI material as a form of review is GREAT! As I left the session, SIL handed out notes organizer worksheets to the students and instructed them to collaborate with the people at their table when completing it.","When I stepped into the room, the students and Emma were in the middle of doing a problem on the board together. The majority of the students were engaged and had their notebooks out, but a few students in the back table were a little distracted and had their cameras out (photo majors lol) and were kind of messing around. Audrey did a good job at correcting their behavior and making sure they were paying attention, but in general, the students' attention should be fully focused on their SI leaders. 

Emma also looked a little nervous (which is totally understandable bc the inverse square law is hard to do in sessions), but just remember that YOU are the one who has taken the class already, not the students!! You passed the class and know the material, so don't be afraid to own up to that! Even if you're nervous, fake it til you make it - the more confident you are in the material, the better your students will feel too, because they are learning from you.

When they reviewed it together, SIL mentioned to the student that he should always show his work, because the work that he had just done might not have gotten the student full credit for the problem. Immediately following this, the student began working on a second problem and SIL stood back to let the student try the problem on their own. The student ended up doing the problem correctly, worth full points if it were on an exam. They celebrated afterwards! I really loved seeing this interaction between SIL and his student. I can tell that even though there was only one student present at the session, they had great rapport and the student is willing to commit to learning. 

Additionally, SIL did well with facilitation techniques. He was strong in all three, but most especially in redirection questions. A second student showed up about 1/3 of the way through the session, and Julio effortlessly caught the student up to speed and encouraged him to jump in to collaborate with the other student, who was working on a graph. SIL did a great job letting the students take the lead to work on the graphs.",I didn't notice an agenda on the board - this was honestly the only thing I noticed!

Because ""does this make sense?"" is a simple yes or no question, it gives your students the opportunity to say yes even if they don't fully understand.

I enjoyed how much collaboration there was between your students when they were solving the problems, but I did not see you check for understanding at all when you moved from one problem to the next. Checking for understanding is super important because it ensures that your students are solid on one topic before moving onto the next one. Here are a few different ways you can check for understanding in future sessions:
- thumbs method: have students hold up thumbs up, thumbs in middle, or thumbs down based on how confident they're feeling in the material
- scale of 1 to 5: similar to thumbs, but with numbers. Just ask your students how they are feeling about the material; 1 is bad and 5 is good, etc

In particular, I like how there is an almost monkey-see, monkey-do action with the plan. In the first half, they had to solve problems where students would write one step or go backward a step if the group felt they were heading in the wrong direction, then in the second half, they would make their own problems and solve them as a group. To me, the session would have promoted collaboration and even studying habits (making their own problems), which I thought was great.

Overall, great session.","For marketing, we discussed different strategies that could be used to promote the session. It seems like there are no exams, and quizzes are online, so marketing for the students has been tricky. With that being said, the SI is doing an amazing job at marketing; he's promoting the sessions during class, emailing everything, using marketing requests such as candy, and even has the professor marketing the SI sessions in class and on the course site. The idea of more long-term marketing was discussed, such as cheat sheets/study guides or more physical things, such as rubber ducks or mugs, via marketing on the website, being used as a reward system."

When the students did get the answer, check for understanding was applied by asking the students to explain their reasoning, and a follow-up question was provided. 

Students felt comfortable asking questions and interacting with each other. 

Promoted future sessions and had reminders when everything was finished. 

To really highlight something, I really liked the use of groups, as it helped promote a friendly atmosphere and gave the students more time to talk about and understand the material instead of just answering questions.","Maybe walk around a bit more to get a feel for how students are feeling while they are actually discussing the questions. It was a little hard to gauge how individual students felt about a question. That group discussion time is a great time to interact with your students and understand where they are at that moment. Especially with a session that size, getting to speak with the students more individually can be important. 

There wasn't too much checking for understanding on the Kahoot questions due to time. Perhaps in the future, the SI might want to keep a closer eye on time during the content portion.

His opener is a great idea as it uses spaced repetition and has the students going over the topic frequently with time between sessions. The activities are a mix between collaborative and independent work which is a great way to show the students how to make independent studying possible in group study sessions. He also allows them to create their own problems which teaches them to create their own, personalized study guide which is a great study strategy. Altogether, I think that's an amazing study plan and I see no issues. I would just say to continue keeping that balance between having individual working opportunities and ensuring they are learning good group study skills.","He has been using candy and targeted review topics, in-class student referrals, and marketing sessions as group study sessions to increase engagement which are all great methods. I suggested punch cards which he is considering implementing. There are some students whose attendance is inconsistent and only for topics they are struggling with which is rather good because it means students are finding sessions helpful. 
We spoke about working with the rest of the cohort for activity ideas. He mentioned he does speak with some of the other SILs for ideas and is making use of some of his cohort now. "

The discussion was a great way to get the students to actively recall material and the SIL did a great job of asking redirecting questions when the students didn't remember something from class. She also checked for understanding on what they wrote by asking questions that they would make them explain their understanding.

The activity where the students had to work together to put together the solution was a great way to have the students collaborate and check their understanding on the method on how to solve the problem.
You also asked some really good questions to thoroughly check their understanding of the material throughout the session.","To make the session seem more like a study group, you could have the students working together on the problems or checking each other's answers before you check it. This would allow them to correct each other, explain their reasoning (which would check their understanding), and show them how to study collaboratively. 
When you do collaborative work, ensure both students are participating as a group in solving the problem.

You gave them some time and space to work on their own (great use of wait-time) before answering their questions or jumping in. Also, you asked great redirecting questions to students when they asked you a question instead of just giving them the solution.

To promote collaboration, you could instead remind the students to help each other or look over each other's code. This will both help the confused student understand and the others to deepen their understanding by explaining the solution and reading someone else's code. 
Also, you could make the activity itself much more collaborative by having them work in pairs. It allows them to discuss the problem with someone else and learn how to study collaboratively even if someone with the solution isn't present.",,,,

* The SI effectively checked for understanding by asking students to explain their reasoning and encouraging discussion.

* The lesson agenda was clear and structured, helping students stay focused. In particular, it looked like the SI had a lot of fun and varied activities planned, which I wish I could have stuck around to see.

* Students felt comfortable collaborating and problem-solving together, and the SI used wait time effectively to support their independent thinking.

* Time was managed well, and the SI was flexible for students to choose their approach to the activities.

* Something I thought was interesting was the use of students having individual whiteboards and then the class whiteboard. It seemed to help more shy students try out things on their own first, before committing to an answer. ","* It seemed at times the main whiteboard was being used by one student. If you notice one student tends to do all the writing for a majority of the session, you might want to try a “driver” system so that all students have turns leading at the board, ensuring balanced participation.

Another activity SIL did was a CS version of the card game ""go fish"" (that's what it seemed like to me lol).

One of his first activities was true or false with different statements from recent content that the professor went over in class recently - I love this idea and wish I would have thought to use it when I was a SIL! He said that the activity would have worked better with a group, and I agree, but I think the one student did a pretty good job on her own. For each question, the student answered true or false and SIL asked the student to explain her reasoning. If the student got a question wrong, SIL checked for understanding by asking the student again to explain why. Each question led into the next and I think this was a great set up on SIL's end. He also did a great job reminding the student to refer to her notes throughout the portion of the session I observed.

SIL also did a great job with wait time and allowed his student as much time as he needed to work through the problem before jumping in if the student had questions.

Aaron said that the content in this activity was similar to what was in the students' labs so he tried to market that to get students to come. After the students work on the problems, each group gives a short presentation about their problem and how they did it, which is a great way to check for understanding.

Aaron said that his relationship with the professor is okay; I recommended reaching out to him to plug SI more in class to hopefully bring in more students for BOTH sessions despite the class size being small. Overall I think Aaron is doing a great job and I really enjoyed his activities that he shared with me!",

Something small, but the SI should make sure to have at least 3 content activities planned out. Even if you plan on not having time and skipping it, in the event the class runs quickly, it's always good to have a backup planned.  
","Marketing:

Suggested using surveys to gather feedback on why students may or may not be showing up, along with incentives on how to get people to fill out those forms:

Offer incentives (e.g., candy night) if a target percentage of the class participates.

Include questions on exam topics (e.g., “How confident are you on topic X, Y, Z?”) to help SIs plan upcoming sessions.

Ask students to rate SI activities that you've done, which can highlight the value of sessions and help you (it also lets no-showers see what they're missing)

Recommended leveraging the teacher as a marketing tool to encourage student participation and awareness of SI sessions, such as attaching SI ads to graded exams. "
