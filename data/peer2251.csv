,"I found the opener very fun, and I might try it in one of my sessions. The activities and closer were good, I like how he went deeper into virtual memory mapping and had them do the mapping themselves, because that likely gave a deeper understanding of it than if they only talked about the concepts of how it worked.",Teddy fostered a comfortable and productive learning environment by being personable and respectful.,"I think Teddy's session was great, the only thing I can think of is that a sometimes when the students would say the right answer, he wouldn't explicitly say they that they were correct, so there might have been a little confusion for a moment.","Teddy checked for understanding very well in his activities by making sure they not only got the right answer, but understood why it was right. And he'd ask follow up questions when it seemed like they may not fully understand.",It was a great session and it was a pleasure observing you!
,"The activities have a lot of variety in terms of content coverage and go very in depth/cover different skills (eg. coding, debugging, guess the output). Good improvising once the activities were gone through faster than planned (went over vocabulary, coding practice). Would like to see more variety in types of activities (using more than just their laptops, maybe paper/whiteboards/kahoot). Great closer - makes future session planning easier for sure.","Even if it was just one student, it was a very well run session. Joined the student to form a cluster so they wouldn't be doing the work on their own, knew their name, was very encouraging when they made a mistake/didn't understand, and adjusted the session to match their pace. ","Try to redirect them before explaining; in one case the student asked what something does, and while they did wait a bit before explaining, it would've been better to have them check their notes/encourage them to figure it out themselves/make them re-explain the concept back to you in their own words. ",Explaining a strategy they like to use for problem solving (eg. when he explained how he solves conditional problems) and checking for understanding afterwards by asking follow up questions. ,"Overall, great session; the student was engaged, they were doing most of the work, they seemed to be understanding, and the problem solving strategies you were sharing will definitely help them in the long run. For future sessions, I would try to use whiteboards/material outside of the laptop and redirect them to their notes before explaining and plan for 50 minutes, not the full hour."
,"The opener was very brief, likely due to the reason that his student came about 5 minutes late. They had a short discussion and then went right into content activities. The first content activity was very straightforward as it was doing math problems on the whiteboard which was clear from the activity name. The SI Leader then moved onto his Kahoot as his next content activity that he did not make so there were some slight issues here and there. The closer seemed to be another conversation with how the students feel about the exam and also lead to another problem on the board.","The SI Leader addressed the student by his first name. The SI Leader talked about the student and his specific experience with the class. The SI Leader also asked his student to move to the front of the room when he tried to sit on the far side of the room. The SI Leader was able to seamlessly bring in a late student when she arrived and have her join in the content activity pretty much right away. I thought it was interesting how the SI Leader had one student check for mistakes of another during his content activity, this demonstrates a high level of trust he has created in his sessions.","The SI Leader could have used a little more wait time with his student as he tended to ask redirecting questions rather fast if the student did not answer right away. If I am not mistaken, this would be wait time 1 specifically the SI Leader could improve upon. Finally, the SI Leader could work on ending his sessions on time being at the 50 minute mark to allow for time to clean up.",The SI Leader did a good job at checking for understanding by asking his student how he felt about the work he did rather than saying if it was correct or not. The SI Leader also did a good job at redirecting questions back to his student to guide the student along with his understanding. The SI Leader did a great job at not alienating a late student and integrating her into his session as if she was there from the beginning.,"The SI Leader clearly knew his subject and did not allow his student to work too far in the wrong direction. The SI Leader may want to consider taking pictures of his student's work to add to his session plans and track learning progress. The SI Leader has done a great job at building trust with his students as they felt comfortable working with him. I also recommend that the SI Leader do higher engagement activities for the opener or closer, or at least define the activities on the agenda a little more."
,"The exam brain dump/cheat sheet creation was a really good way to get students feeling more confident in their knowledge. Working on the review worksheet in clusters is a really good activity for a pre-exam session. The closer being a fun activity is my preferred way to hold sessions, so I think SIL did a really good job with the way she chose to structure things. She didn’t have time to get to the closer, but I think because the students have an exam so soon, that’s okay, as they would probably prefer to spend more time focusing on the content.","She started off by having some small talk with students as they were getting settled into session, which definitely personalizes the experience. I like that she migrated around the room to check on student progress during the opener and worksheet.  ","SIL did jump in to tell students if they were wrong or right once or twice and she could possibly work on having students consult with each other before answering questions that the students themselves are unsure of. Eventually, when the room got more talkative, students did this on their own, which was really great to see, but if she could somehow facilitate them to talk to each other about questions and confer on answers, that would be really in line with the SI principles. ","SIL has good relationships with her students and her co-lead. She actually utilized her co-lead to her benefit, asking questions when she was unsure of something and conferring to ensure she was giving students correct information. It was obviously her session, but I like that she actually utilized her relationships to make the session better for students. I also like that her session felt like dedicated work time for the exam. I think the way Suva operates during her sessions makes them more helpful to her students.","Hi SIL! I think you’re naturally a really good SIL. I think this style of session works really well for an exam review session. I also liked that you encouraged students to work in clusters but still understood that for exam prep, they would most likely want to work on their own because they take the exam on their own. I also liked how you gauged students' feelings on the exam before the session (you reminded me to add this to my own session). Generally, the only thing I think you could have worked on was defaulting more to having students answer each other’s questions first during the opener and during the practice problems. Besides that, your session was clearly well-planned. I love the style of keeping the first part of session more content-focused so that by the time students are tired of having to focus, they can do a more fun activity. Amazing job today, keep it up:) "
,"The opener is very fun. It was an online game where there are multiple stars on a graph. players are given a function, and they must change at least one number in the function to have the line go through the stars. This is a great math related game that helps students to visualize the domain and range of functions in a fun way.

The first activity was a brain dump. Sydney had the student write down all the derivative rules that they could remember. Sydney would point out when the student made a mistake and would wait for the student to realize their mistake. She let the student know that they could refer to their notes SIL was very personable and friendly to the student. She fostered a positive environment for learning.

The second activity was a series of practice problems. Sydney employed great wait time while letting the student solve the problems. Sydney never gave the student the answer, she would always ask the student a question to get her to think about her answer.

For the closer, they played wordle and nerdle. Nerdle a fun math related game. And the student seemed to enjoy it.","SIL had one student, so the interactions were personal, Sydney would never do problem for the student she would just guide the student towards the answer by using hints and thought provoking questions ","N/A, she did a phenomenal job",She employed great wait time. She answered all of the student's questions with another question and helped them discover the answer on their own.,SIL handled her session very well.
,"The session was planned very well, the activity had a lot of effort put into well crafted practice questions given to the students to work on during the session. The questions went over the course material thoroughly and mimicked what the students would see in the classroom. ","The SI worked very well, making sure the students were tended to when needed, but gave them ample time to work through the activities on their own. They made sure to ask more questions than give answers and checked for a periodic understanding through this questioning.","The SI while is consistent with deflecting questions can work on wait time. The students, even while not looking for an answer still need time to think before another question is thrown at them. ","The SI was very good at expressing themselves throughout the session and gave off the impression that they both, knew what they were doing, and were prepared for it. The SI leader conducted themselves in a wonderful manner that’s let the students build on their skills through the activity without external help, but rather guidance.","The overall session went well, although it’s hard when trying to give students time to answer instead of thinking about the next question to ask them, count in your head. If there still not getting it after some more time, then think of the question and that should end up giving them more wait time to decipher the answer themselves."
,"SI Leader skipped the opener since students came in late. SI leaders had a cipher game planned out, but unfortunately only one student showed up, but the SI leader did a great job at transforming that activity into a whiteboard activity that also helped the students to review about cipher. SI leader did a survey about feedback on SI session for closer, which I think is great to know what student like. ","SI leaders chat about the class and exam in a casual way with the students, and shared his own experiences of taking exams. This makes the SI feel more like a ""Student"" not a ""Faculty"", which I think will make students feel more comfortable in the session. ",I think the SI should do more check for understaffing during the session. ,"I like how the SI leader guide students step by step through a question instead of giving the answer directly. Also the SI handed over a marker to the student and make her go to the whiteboard to solve a problem, this ensure student have a chance to do the questions by themselves. ","The content activities was well-planned out. I like how you interact with the students, making them feel friendly and comfortable in session. I think you did a great job at guiding the students through practice problems, but I think you should also incorporate some sort of check for understanding within the activity. "
,"I think the opener was very creative in that a ""spot the error"" puzzle example was introduced to explain the concept and usage of ciphers. This seemed more helpful than jumping straight into having students practice solving a cipher. The activity was to have students look at an error function where an outOfBoundIndex would be reached and false concatenation of a string and integer value occurs. I think was a good connection between real world puzzles to code puzzles and greatly helps student practice debugging skills. The closer was also interesting where we plaed NYT pip. Though it wasn't a code based activity, I think it was a great closer to wrap up and held the focus of the session that ciphers are essentially just puzzles that encrypts a message or passcode.","The session was a no-show but I would predict the session would have created a very comfortable and productive learning environment. When Mohamed walked through his session plan with me, he showed very positive energy and spoke in a tone that makes me feel he understands very well what he was teaching.",Mohamed can create a slideshow or a table of contents to display on board as the session is running. It would help students know what is expected on the day and can help students who came late catch up with the class. It would also be a great way to organize the structure of the session in more details than the session plan google docs.,Mohamed definitely made the session very interactive and fun. The overall atmosphere didn't feel like a tutoring or lecture session and it encouraged learning through fun methods. I can sense that implementing games into SI sessions is his main strategy and it is working out very well.,"Overall, Mohamed's sessions were very welcoming, fun, and very helpful in helping students reinforce understanding of the class materials. It's great that he intentionally give trick questions to have the students think critically. If the sessions kept the same style as it is right now, students would definitely come more frequently but only if they had attended at least once. Mohamed can try new advertising strategy other than just emailing. Strategies such as offering snacks and java tokens would boost attendance and help keep students coming regularly. "
,"I thought the opener was a little basic since it was just asking about the weekend. Her activities were really strong and very interactive, and they checked the student’s understanding well. It was clear she put in a lot of effort, with printed activity sheets and a slideshow to support the session. Even though she didn’t get to the closer, based on the other activities and how the session went, I’m confident it would have gone well. The closer was a brain dump, and I felt the student would have left the session confident in what he learned today.","I think she interacted with the student really well and brought great energy to the session. She had a high spirit and was very kind with the student. Even when the student was stuck on problems, she stayed patient and guided them through each step. This created a comfortable and productive learning environment.","The SI leader could have had a stronger opener to better engage the group right away, but the four activities she included really helped keep students involved and made the session interactive. The different activities also showed good preparation and kept the pace moving. Overall, I think she did really well and created a supportive environment where students could practice and participate actively.","I really like how the SI leader adjusted her session for her regular student. When the student was stuck, she didn’t just give the answer but helped guide them to it. This made the student think more and feel more confident. It showed she understood the student’s needs and could explain things in a helpful way.",The general feedback I would share with the SI Leader is to keep doing what you’re doing. Amina did a great job checking for understanding by asking the student to solve the question and tell them explain how they got the answer.

Opener: Dream American Vacation
Fun concept! Not material related, gave students an opportunity to just think and share in a fun way. But then, it turned into math by connecting the points. Super clever. That's a fun way to review the definition of differentiability with students. 

Activity Derivative rules that you know (testing knowledge):
Good way to get students thinking and working on important recall
Asking why and checking for understanding w/ student questions, letting students answer

Activity Derivatives Practice:
Good variety of examples that flowed nicely
Redirected questions by letting students think towards answers, just gentle suggestions
Supporting questions to help understanding were great
Asking students to explain their answers to other students, helping both
""Summarize the process for how you did this"" I love asking students that

Closer:
N/A","Casual, very relaxed. Minimal distractions to support focus on the material. Fun banter.","Occasional direct corrections, it may be more helpful to let students make mistakes and let them figure out what they did wrong, you sometimes would say things like ""so you didn't use the correct rule for this part"" or things like that
I might say something like ""is this correct? How do you know? Which rules did you use to get this?""","Session was incredibly solid in a lot of ways. Super fun opener that tied in review, I loved that, good use of the SI Model during review activities. Great relaxed vibe. ","Great work this was an awesome session! If I have any criticism I would just say to ask students to justify their answers more to make sure they understand what it is they're doing, but even that you did very well on. "
,"Opener:
Opener was fun and interactive; it allowed every student to participate by making a sentence to coherently combine them together, fostering collaboration among each other (it was Mad Libs).

Activity:
Activity was very SI spot on. The activity was some type of round robin, where Joe had the student(s) walk around and select answers by going to the correct table, each one having different derivatives. He never gave the answer directly and always hinted at what could be possibly right, while also having students explain the answers to each other!

Closer: Did a arobic trick with the students! ","Joe was very comfortable with the students, and they were comfortable with him. They clearly trusted him and weren’t afraid to ask any questions, no matter how small. Joe fostered a collaborative environment by making fun examples and engaging in back-and-forth conversations with the students.","Make the agenda more descriptive when written on the board—perhaps list the specific tasks for each section in case a student is interested. Also, consider incorporating more whiteboard examples or showing steps on the whiteboard, might help students to look at your work as reference ie. like doing a example together first with the professor before getting into the work. ","The learning activity was really good, very collaborative with having the students walk around and never be sitting down. ",Great job—students clearly enjoy being in the classroom. I would suggest making the agenda more descriptive and  incorporating examples with steps on the board. Other than that great job being an SI so far. 
,"Opener (Rose, Thorn + Buds): Great way to get students talking in the beginning of the session.

Activities: Great job giving the students incorrect problems so they have to identify the issues and correct them. Classic checking for understanding! Finding the second derivative problems are also great, but when doing the quotient rule it gets a little messy and take a long time to solve so you might want to do second derivative problems with rules other than quotient. ",She made the students feel comfortable by asking about how they feel their exam went. During the activity she allowed the students to lead the discussion on the board. The SI and the students had very good back and forward communication. ,You might benefit from having the problems already written on the board before session or you can project the question on the board so you don't spend as much time writing them n the board during session.,You did a great providing examples that cleared up the students question and concerns. I also really liked how quickly you got the late comer up to speed in the actvivty you were doing. Helping her one on one while the other student continued working on the activity was awesome especially as she needed a little more help!,"I love the first type of activities you have at your sessions, they work on very important skills like checking your own work! Love that the students asked for their candy lol."
,"Aaron started by asking the student how they felt about the midterm. This quickly turned into a discussion, a good opener activity to get a feel for how confident they are in the subject. During the session, they went through multiple coding activities with python turtle on the board, to prepare for the practical exam. The closer was a fun coding part, where the student drew a complex shape and Aaron had to make the code for it.","Aaron took a very personal approach to teaching. He guided the student through the problems, helping when needed and congratulating the student when they solve a problem. I also liked the fact that he took a multi-step approach to each problem; after each problem, the turtle shape would become gradually more complex. Aaron was asking the right questions on each step, inviting the student to challenge themselves: How would you do that? Do you want to draw that on the board?",Aaron could have delved into the questions that the student came into the session with instead of following his scheduled activities.,"He invited the student to explain their thinking out loud, and assisted with problem solving when needed.","Keep up the good work. Maybe change your A section to a different date or time, to "
,"Opener: 
The opener was a much appreciated derivative rules review which for a class that wants to get right into the subject is great for them to get into the right mind space. Putting music on during the session isn't something that I would have ever thought of even though its such a simple concept it allows the session to feel more welcoming which is nice to see.
Activities: 
(THIS OR THAT) This activity would enforce on what the student does or doesn't know with Katina showing constants/exponential functions and the student has to sort it out themselves. This activity I think was great at making students reiterate what they already know. 
(CONSTANT MULTIPLIER BREAKDOWN) What I like the most about this activity is how it built off the activity before this. The first activity allowed the student to practice the topic a bit so they could be ready to answer this activity with what they just learned.
(DERIVATIVE PRACTICE) Same concept as the last one with how it built of the activity before this. Even then Katina would make sure the student would have the EXACT correct answer even with the smallest of errors. Katina would also always ask the student for the steps they took. 
Unfortunately with only one student Katina's got finished up rather quickly. 
Closer:
Classic checking closer which works effectively to see what the students learned this session and allowing themselves to realize this fact too.",Katina has a very chill welcoming way they interact with students.  To improve the students learning environment Katina also moved a white board to a better position for them to write on. Throughout the session Katina always make sure the students understand why they got the answer they got even if they were right. This is basically the perfect learning environment a SI session is trying to achieve.,I think its important to have thought of backup problems in case sessions go faster than expected. So just for the future have just a small little side session in the back of your mind or coming up with one on the stop I think would be important to think about.,Katina is amazing at checking for understanding. I would always hear no matter the problem the student talking about it more than Katina himself. He is great at applying the self learning SI wants. Most of Katina's activities would want more than one student in attendance but even he was able to mold this session easily for the one student that showed up.,Keep up with the great sessions Katina! I really liked how everything was organized and conducted!
,I think the opener and closer were cute! They related to the students' interests and that seems to help foster a good relationship with the students.,"- He seem to know the students' friendships & relations well enough to leverage them to have others come.
- The choice of activity helps with setting a friendly mood for the session.
- I like that he were friendly wit the students and acted like you were just another classmate.
- I like that he complimented the students when they were doing well to build some sense of competition among the students.","I think he could consider coming up with other activities that don't just involve one person doing the problem.
The SIL could also consider doing the facilitation methods more, primarily redirecting questions and wait time.","- I like that he wrote the title large & big.
- Fostered/maintained a sense of rivalry among the students to get them to come to sessions
- Remembering names of other classmates who might not come to sessions
- Participating in students' conversations.","In general, introduce more variety and flavor in activities, and practice the facilitation methods more. I think it's great that you're able to maintain a welcoming and fun environment for your students. Keep up the great work!"
,"	The opener was a unique and fun way to gauge the general mental state of the room. The students were engaged in the activity and communicating clearly with one another. 
The activities had many interactive elements, which were a good way to keep the students engaged. Additionally, the students were tasked with activities which would clearly demonstrate the skills they learned in class. The SI leader also allowed the students to work through the problems on their own, rather than simply relecturing the students. The SI leader was clearly prepared with different activities and  problems for the students to solve. 
The closer was a good way to wind down from the activities, and allowed the students to continue engaging with one another in a less educational setting. ","
	The instructor was very friendly with the students, and had familiar and open discussions with them about the class. The SI leader would also give the students prompting answers to questions, rather than just giving them the correct answer. The SI leader gave the students adequate time to work on the activities, and didn’t rush or pressure the students, allowing them to learn at their own pace. The students were eager to attend the SI leader’s session, and clearly gained a lot from the session, learning more about both the subjects taught in class and the basic foundations behind them. Students were encouraged to collaborate with each other and openly discuss the problems being solved. The overall atmosphere was very welcoming and engaging.  ","	One thing the SI leader could improve on is giving some clearer instructions on activities, as some students seemed confused initially. This wasn’t a major issue however, as students were soon able to grasp the activity and go about completing it. ","The SI leader did a good job of not simply giving students the answer, rather the SI leader would help them find the right path forward. When the students encountered a difficult problem, rather than directly explaining the solution to the problem, the SI leader led the students in the correct direction. Students were also encouraged to collaborate with each other to find the correct answer, rather than just seeking confirmation from the SI leader. After the students were able to figure out the correct answer, the SI leader gave them a good amount of positive reinforcement, giving them the confidence to move forward in solving the given problems for the activity.","The session was very fun and informative, and I felt that it was a good way to review the material learned in the class. The students seemed to enjoy collaborating with each other, and the SI leader ensured that the environment of the session was very welcoming and educational. "
,"The opener was fun, Rylan got people up to write on the board about their favorite brands and speak with each other.","Generally there is good banter among the group.
Rylan is good at being comfortable with letting the students speak and figure things out themselves.
He always turns the activity into an active or visual form for the students.
He also tries to include everyone into each discussion or activity.",Maybe he could do more checks for understanding with students that struggle with the material. He is good at addressing the problem they have understanding but after they work through the problem the students don't really prove that they understand the general concept.,He does a good job with letting the students talk without interrupting or taking too much control over them.,"Overall Rylan has a very active and fun SI session. He does great at interacting with the students and letting them explore the topic and activity with minimal guidance.
The big point of improvement is finding a way to get the struggling students more active and improve their understanding."
,"The opener was a PIXAR film Tier List. I thought this was a really good opener and something I will definitely use in my sessions. Will did a crossword for his activity, and this was a really good way to go over all of the different vocab you need to know/use in programming. The second activity he did was two teams, which was a game where the two students who came would race to solve different types of problems.  The closer that was planned was the connections game. ",The SIL had a very welcoming environment and had great conversations with the students who came. The vibe of the session was really chill and allowed the students to just have genuine conversations with him. The students seemed very comfortable with him and each other. ,"The SI leader could work on not just saying yes when the student gets the answer correct, however when were really good at giving clues when the students didn't know or weren't sure about the answer. ",The SI leader did a great job talking to both of the students who came and creating a warm and welcoming environment. The SI leader also did a great job with planning this lesson because it seemed very well thought out. ,"The students were really good at explaining things to each other,  and what they got right to the student who got the question wrong. "
,"They didn’t do an opener since student was 10 minutes late, so we went straight into the activity which was going over exam and quiz problems students had struggled with. The other activity was nice if there were more students, but they had a problem and alternated who did the next step and explained their process between steps. Overall, the activities were good and they way they were executed were well. ",They allowed the student to walk through their thought process and first find their mistakes before they go over it together. They also talked to the student about how their other classes are going. ,They can improve with wait time and could explain things a little more in depth rather than just using example after example. ,They redirected questions well and allowed students to look back at their notes before they answered any questions. ,"I liked how you used simpler examples to help the student remember the exponent rules and it helped them find their own mistakes. We talked about different marketing strategies, I think you should push more of those out to students. I also don’t know if it’s required but somewhere for students to write down their name and section. They should also have times on the agenda rather than the order of the activities. "
,"The opener was an interesting matrix problem that immediately got the student thinking and engaged. The activities were very hands-on and effective, I especially liked how he incorporated writing code and drawing diagrams on the whiteboard. This really helped visualize the concepts. The closer, having the student summarize the main takeaway, ensured they solidified the most important concept before leaving. ","Steven was really patient and created a low-pressure vibe. He'd ask a question and then give the student a solid 15-20 seconds of quiet time to think it through before saying anything. This kept the student from feeling rushed or put on the spot, just enough to help them get unstuck without taking over.","Redirect students to their notes or the professor's notes before explaining a concept. This encourages them to become more self-sufficient and reinforces using their primary course resources, which is important when they need help for courses not supported by SI.","He was really good at keeping the student engaged and the student were actively participating. I loved how he had them write on the whiteboard and draw out diagrams and code. Because he created such a supportive environment, the student felt comfortable asking a ton of questions, and by the end, all their confusion was totally cleared up.","it was a really solid session, especially for just one person. You made them do the heavy lifting with your hints and the wait time, which was way better than just giving them the answers. It was cool to see how many questions the student felt comfortable asking by the end. Maybe just try throwing an agenda on the board next time, but other than that, great job. You definitely helped them get it!"
,The opener was highs and lows of the weeks. I think this is a great plan to gauge the room and see how the students are doing in the class. The activities were pretty well-planned. I acted as the student and we went through the opener and the first activity which was analyzing errors in a given snippet of code. ,,"I think perhaps arriving a little earlier to write the code on the board could save some time in in the session. Due to the no-show, it was difficult to see the SI leader in action, but from my observation, there wasn't much the SI leader could work on improving at this time (which is really good)","The SI leader seemed really prepared to tackle confused responses and uncertainty by redirecting the question back to the person who asked the question and slowly walking through the beginning steps of a problem to help, which is really good. I acted as the student, and when I had trouble on a certain problem, the SI leader was very great at breaking it down into smaller pieces to help me analyze the problem at its core. This will be very helpful to students in general. ","Great job playing out the session with me. From my perspective, if it wasn't a no-show, it would've went really well! The activities you have planned seem really engaging and content-rich. You know the subject and you're doing a really good job. "
,"The opener (MOPS Chameleon) was really fun! It seems like he's done this opener before and I think it's a good warm-up to get students working up at the whiteboard and thinking about what we learned recently in lectures.
The activities also went well. I liked that he broke the struct activity up into steps and had a student or group explain their work after one of these steps to check for understanding.","It seems like most (if not all) of the students at the session have come to previous sessions and he's done a good job making students feel comfortable working with him and each other. Also, it looks like he had some good prizes for games, which probably also helps!",Write the agenda on the board!,"I think he did a really good job of making students feel comfortable in the session and used collaborative techniques really effectively (the work in smaller groups/""clusters"" went well).",I think the session went really well! I really liked the opener. Just remember to write the agenda on the board so students know what's happening if they're late!
,"Her opener started with an “element” activity, where everyone shared which element they resembled. I found this very engaging, and it immediately got the group talking and comfortable with each other. The activities were well structured — starting with a brain dump on Lewis structures, where students explained their answers on the board to the rest of the class. She encouraged students to respond to each other’s questions, which kept the discussion active. For group work, she divided the class into three groups based on their confidence with Lewis structures, and each group volunteered to answer questions step by step. This structure allowed everyone to participate meaningfully. The session ended with a clear wrap-up, and she reminded students of the end time, which helped keep the session organized.","She made sure to greet everyone as they arrived, including latecomers, and ensured they were smoothly integrated into the ongoing activity. She encouraged participation by redirecting questions to other students rather than answering them herself, fostering peer learning. She used clear expectations (like her 1–5 rule) to set a supportive tone and made sure no one was left with unanswered questions.","Nil, she did great ","She did an excellent job encouraging active participation and making sure every student had a chance to contribute. Her opener was creative, and her group division strategy was thoughtful, allowing students to work at their comfort level while still being challenged.","Overall, the session was engaging, well-paced, and interactive. She created a welcoming atmosphere, and the activities supported deep learning. With a bit more time management during group work, the session would be even more effective."
,"I loved the creative way she implemented snippets of the content into the opener (making fun riddles about topic of the Session). I think its a great way to catch the attention and set a positive, engaging tone for the session.","It was a no-show, so I didn't really see the way Irin interacted with the students","Maybe try implementing different activity types to boost engagement within the session. Since Irin mentioned that students are sometimes reluctant to participate, activities framed in a more playful or interactive way could help. For example, instead of just giving a list of problems to solve, present them as a “hangman” game where students must work together to solve the problems and uncover the word. Another idea is to break down problems into simpler, smaller concepts, which could make students more active and also highlight exactly where they are getting stuck.","Again, I loved the riddles she came up with. They made the opener feel fresh and fun","Even though this session ended up being a no-show, your preparation and creativity were very clear. Keep experimenting with engaging formats like riddles, games, or concept breakdowns — they can really encourage students to participate more actively once they’re in the room. You’re doing a great job of making the content approachable, and that kind of energy will definitely pay off in future sessions."
,"Opener (NYT Pips): I thought this was a good opener, it was kinda difficult since the student did not know of the game prior. It was not content related but still a good opener and got the session going. 

Activity 1 (Rule Match Up): Student was given a rule and told to match it to a function to differentiate around the room (hung up on the wall with flash cards). I think that this is a great activity to help practice identifying when to use each rule when you see certain types of problems. 

Activity 2 (Derivative Relay): I think this activity was meant to be a differentiating competition, but there was only one student in attendance so he ""competed"" against the SIL. I think despite this that it was still a well planned activity and was good practice for the student. A second student arrived halfway through this activity and joined in the competition, this made the activity more engaging and better practice.

Closer (Wordle): This is a good closer in my opinion as it is fun and everyone knew how to play already.","The SI Leader seems to personally know many of the students who attended, she mentioned that they are in the same major. They seemed comfortable enough to have normal conversations and it seemed to be a sign that they come to sessions frequently.","Not much improvement is needed, sometimes conversations got a little off topic but that is expected and helps the students feel more engaged.","The SI leader came very well prepared, when I arrived the room was already set up with activity cards on the wall, and the session outline written on the board.","Overall session was really good, would have worked smoother with more students but that is out of your control. Great session plan and activities."
,"Opener was asking people how they did on an exam. It's a good opener to use after an exam. Activities made a lot of sense for a calc SI session, although simple they were very effective. ",Leader was quite comfortable with the students and joked with them. They seemed very comfortable. They treated the students as if they actually knew them personally while maintaining boundaries. He was also well aware of which students would know the content less and made sure to keep them in the loop and check for their understanding. ,Would be nice to give the students a hint if they've been stuck on a problem for a very long time. Also to keep all students and engaged at all times. It can be tough if there's a really smart student who seems to know the answer to every problem while the rest are confused.,"The SI leader checked for understanding, redirected questions, and utilized wait time effectively. Took his time with longer problems. I could also tell the SI leader had a deeper understanding of the problem. Also did a warm up for the content which is nice. ","I love that you spent a lot of the session working on one very complex problem. I don't have much feedback. One time it seemed like a student was lost while the rest were solving a complicated question. It would be a good idea to ask the students to recap or to have one of them catch up the confused student so they're not just sitting there. I really liked this session, one of the best I've seen in a while."
,"Opener: 

The SI Leader opened with Highs and Lows since they haven't done them in a while. I thought it was a nice opener because students had their midterm last week and the SI Leader can gauge where students might feel with the new unit. 

Activity 1: Ranges Practice
Activity 2: String Indexing
Activity 3: For Loops

The SI Leader prepared a list of questions to review the range() function and its application. For each question, the SI Leader prepared questions that checked for understanding, such as ""What index might we start from if we want to access the end of the word?"" or ""Why do we stop at x if we want to print until x-1?"" The SI Leader definitely knows how to check for understanding and even incorporated that into the session with me alongside excellent use of wait time. 

Closer: 

The SI Leader closed with a reflection that asked students what may have confused them, what clicked, and their confidence level from 1 - 5. I think that this is a great opportunity to see where students are at and plan accordingly for next time. ","This was a no show, but I ran through the activities with the SI to see how they would do. They did well in implementing wait time even when I was the only one there. They also made it clear that had students come, they would have had them collaborate and produce code on the whiteboard while the review questions would be a group discussion. ","Since there were no students, I would say that this is not a fair assessment of their performance. However, maybe this can be a chance for the SI Leader to advertise their lessons more or find other means of bringing students in. ","The SI Leader had a very comprehensive slideshow, complete with problems and questions. I think that the SI Leader was very organized in making this and that it helps the students clearly understand what to do. ","I think that the SI Leader did an excellent job in preparing for their session and presenting to me. It is unfortunate that no students showed up this time, but keep your head up and keep moving forward!"
,"Opener: how did the exam go? This was pretty good, I think it would work better with a group, so you can redirect questions but it was a good chance for the student to ask questions and get clarity 
Activity: covalent compound practice; This was kind of like what I would call a mini lecture review. They went through content from class and had the student answer before filling in the blanks on the slide with an answer key. There were some good questions where the student had to demonstrait their knowlege (which allowed Elena to test for understanding). The ""relationship"" analogy seemed very helpful! 
Closer: infinite craft; unfortunately the student left before this but its a very fun game","Yes, definitely! There was only one student, and Elena did a great job asking them specific questions about their exam this morning, and working through what they needed. I can imagine it may be intimidating to be the only student, but Elena made them feel very comfortable. ","I think the session was a little bit lecture-y, but I understand that it's hard not to do that when there aren't enough students to collaborate. There was one slide where they were talking the stuctures of molecule compounds and it seemed like a good opportunity for students to piece together the structure (prefix, suffix, etc.) together. ",Creating a comfortable learning environment and adapting the session plan to accommodate only having one student. Also validating the student for their successes and pushing them to expand on their answers to check for understanding. ,I would love to see some activities that get students moving around (and collaborating if applicable)
,"Loved the opener! Super chill, fun for the season, and really got the student talking! I thought the content was very appropriate - they reviewed the questions the student got wrong on the exam. Reviewing mistakes is fantastic to check understanding and ensure the student brushes up the foundational skills they were missing, because I know in math courses you need to know things from one unit to move on to the next. As a closer they went over other resources the student can utilize which was awesome.","Yes, the SIL is very warm and approachable, has no problem talking to students. It was obvious students felt super comfortable at the session. They chatted about the opener, classes, the exam, etc. ","The SIL did not have the agenda on the board, which should be done in the future. Additionally, the SIL was in a room in WAL that is locked and hard to look into, I had to knock to get let in. I think that can scare people away from the session if they're already hesitant and then they arrive and they can't tell if the session is being held or not because they can't see in and the door is locked. I recommend as soon as you get there propping the door open, even if you're not set up you can make small talk while setting up which is what I do.","The SIL had a great opener and is great at talking to students and building rapport. The SIL brought stickers which is a great marketing strategy - other students might see the stickers and ask about SI, gives students a reason to come, so great job! The content was super great and appropriate. The session was very student led and not lecture-y at all which was awesome! Love that you talked about other resources available to the student for help!","Overall, this was a great session! The opener was fun and a great way to break ice, build rapport, and get students talking. The content was appropriate and helpful for students - going over past mistakes on an exam is awesome!! The session was student led, and the student obviously felt comfortable in your session environment! Going forward I recommend leaving the door propped open as soon as you arrive at the session room so students know they can come in/ have found the right room, and make sure you remember to write the agenda on the board so students know what to expect. Other than that great job! Keep up the good work! :)"
,The opener was really good for getting the students involved and checking to make sure the angles for the unit circle were right. The matching activity was really nice for the students because it allowed for them to do practice problems without just being practice problems. One of the students would help them out with explaining how the trig identities you can solve them quicker. ,He was talking with the students but he also kept  it on task and he would talk to the students about certain topics gone over in class to allow him to get a gauge on what does or doesn't make sense. He was very open on what worked for him to solve the identities and the unit circle.,I think that there could be maybe some games or something involved but I think that for the current students that were there it was a good set up.,He allowed the students to work on the problems and figure out what worked for him.,The session you ran was really good and I think is a pretty good session. The way you explained things was really good. I think this was overall really good session and students were engaged the whole time.
,"There was not really an opener, I do not blame him, as it took him technical difficulties to set the monitor up.","Listened to students feedback, and gave out prizes when they got prizes, which motivates them.",Let the other student answer the other students question instead of answering it themselves.,Foster a productive learning environment and have a friendly atmosphere. Asks good follow up questions.,"Try having some variety with the whiteboard activities, like races between each other, creating friendly competition. "
,"This was a no show session (talked with Owen about his opener, activities, and closer, with him running one with me). I thought they were engaging and would have worked well for students, focusing on graphing and algebra techniques (Piecewise Functions, general graphing).",,"Using our marketing tactics to try get more students to show up, such as offering candy, ducks, or even preparing for the quizzes (since there are no exams in Math 101). After talking, Owen shared that it is a smaller class (12 students) where many of the students don't even show up, so I think just focusing on the ones that do and maybe asking them what they might need help on would potentially get students to show up.","The activities planned were super engaging for the students and made sense with the content. Owen was clearly utilizing collaborative learning techniques from an SI perspective but as a student, it would just seem like you were working in a group or with a partner.","Consider reaching out to your co-hort to see if any of them are also having attendance issues and maybe do a ""mid-semester"" bonus session (can market as a way to improve grades with even half a semester left). Overall, best of luck and hopefully others show up in the future!"
,The Opener was geoguesser which didn't work because Zoe couldn't get the TV to connect to his computer,Zoe did a good job making the discussion feel comfortable. I felt like I could talk to him very casually ( like a friend). ,The SI could work on making his activities more interactive. He had two questions for his students to work on. The first was a Venn Diagram and the second was drawing a UML diagram. These activities are fine for learning concepts but they don't always make for the most fun SI session.,Zoe did a great job explaining what he had planned for the session and moving from activity to activity. He's a good communicator,Zoe could work on designing more interesting activities
,"I thought the activities were very interesting, and they allowed the students to work collaboratively",SIL made sure to be relatable with the students to make a comfortable environmemt,"I think the resume activity kinda dragged on for a bit too long, but that's a weird one-off activity anyways",I thought the planning for the activities was strong,I loved the rapport you had with the students! The environment felt very welcoming.
,"I thought the opener was great, starting off with a good introduction into the topics of the session that was fun and interactive through Two Truths and a Bug. The activity was a good way to help divide the subjects and create a nice build-up by starting with the bare basics and leading up to the overall theme.","It was mostly bouncing back between the SI Leader and the students. The students would collaborate together on answering the problem at hand, and he would facilitate, moving the conversation along through redirecting questions and other techniques. ","I think they could have made a more direct approach for checking for understanding. There were a few moments where the topic of conversation moved-on, but I felt that the student, while technically answering, was maybe a bit confused still.","I think their interactions with the students were very well. They did a great job making them feel comfortable in the environment,  and had a great rapport with them. ","Overall, really enjoyed the session. He has a great rapport with his students, the activity was nicely done, and I think he did a great job. "
,"Opener - Conversation on career fair - I liked it. It had his students talking about the fair, what to expect, what they need to know etc. 

Activities - I like the review of content, making sure that the students have a good grasp of what was taught. There were only two students, and it seemed like only one was really participating while the other would stay on his computer and chime in once in a while. That is not SIL's fault, but I do think there could have been some ways to have both students participate in the activities.

Closer - Pictionary was fun! The students had a good time, and he made it content-based as well, so it was a little review of what was covered in the session","I think he has good conversations with his students. They feel comfortable asking him questions, and he showed his personality during the session. He asked questions that ensured understanding, and chose people to answer certain questions to make sure everyone knew, and it is not just one person answering the questions.","More collaboration from students, making it more student-led than SI-led. In the beginning, it went well with that, but as we went throughout the session, it felt a little lectury with only the SI leader writing things out, and the students' answers/asking questions.","Consistently asks his students questions to make sure they understand the content. 
Facilitated conversations with the students and was engaging. 
Had some time at the end for Q & A (didn't have to be content based) - I really liked that, I never thought of doing that","Great session! I am an SI leader for General Chemistry, so it is cool to see how a different session would go that isn't chemistry-related! You did a great job making sure that both students understood the topics, and you did a great job asking/answering questions! The career fair opener is a great way to open the floor about questions or concerns about the fair, since many first years don't really know how to go about that.

For improvements, it could be a little more collaborative. I am not in econ, nor do I know if this is how a usual session goes, but I do think that maybe having the students draw out the graphs or have you draw the graph and have the students fill it out would be a great idea!

Also really liked the Pictionary and the Q and A! I will definitely use some of that for my sessions :)

Great job today, I'm so happy I got to observe!"
,"The opener was great! It was really fun and festive for the students to get into the Halloween spirit :) The candy certainly elevated the festivities too! I liked this session a lot and it seems that the students were really engaged! I felt like the spirit of SI was present in the room because of the collaborative environment that was created. Overall, really great session :)",I liked how the SIL broke the students up into pairs and had them work together on problems. It really encouraged students to help each other rather than relying on the SIL! The SIL also did a great job at asking clarifying questions to check for understanding. The room was also nicely arranged to create a more collaborative setting which was really nice. ,"I noticed that the SIL was starting to lecture a bit (the SIL speaking more than the students) which could have been partly influenced by how the session activites were structured. Ideally, the students should be doing more of the talking/writing; the students that know the answer should also be encouraged to teach struggling students. Otherwise, no other suggestions for improvement come to mind!",The SI leader did really well at redirecting questions when students were stuck. I noticed it helped them get to the answer. They did great at creating a welcoming atmosphere for students to come learn. I also liked that the SIL used examples from class to help guide students to the answer. ,"Overall, really great session :) The activities you planned were really content-rich and engaging. It seemed like the students got a lot out of this session! You are doing a really amazing job and I can tell that you really enjoy what you are doing. "
,"Opener: pretty good, this was a fun way to break the ice

Activity 1: mini recap, this was really good! Everyone participated, and there were good guiding questions. Redirected questions to other students who understood and could explain it. They went around and helped lead students to find the answers on their own by writing them out and having them explain them. Then, pausing to double-check some things and showing them a different way to think about it. They then had the students explain it to one another, where they caught their own mistakes. They asked questions to check for understanding. Then, once they explained where the student went wrong after they got stuck, they had them reattempt the question and had them say what went wrong before. Did eyes close 1-5 for understanding?

Activity 2: Students discuss together and write out different questions about polarity. Redirected questions to other students. Positive reinforcement and wait time for other students to finish. Did a good job with wait time and letting them answer. When everyone was stuck, they did a little demonstration without saying the answer, and the students got it. Beautiful mind map to help visualize content.

Activity 3: What type of bonds: they had a student come up and write out the ranges. Great wait time and calling on students when they knew they could answer. Everyone participated equally, which was nice to see. What they notice from her drawing. This was such a creative way to recap and have them point out things they have learned and show their knowledge about this. They ended at a spot to pick up next time, showing repetition spacing!

Closer: High, low, buffalo (good, low, random): grow community connections and see what is going on in everyone's life.","They welcomed everyone in and talked to them before the session, getting to know them. They divided in a way to help make sure everyone understood. They joked around and made the space feel super safe. Good positive feedback and encouragement. Gave compliments, encouraged students who were hesitant to answer, and had fun little graphics to break up the content. ","You could ask them how they feel before an activity on the content to see the difference. A bit more confidence, especially in the first activity. ",They did a great job with redirecting and letting students work through their questions. ,"Killed it!! This was a great, super chill session. I could see moments where each student had their aha moment and learned something new. You did such a nice job having them solve their own questions and explain their work!"
,The opener was spooky birds. I think that Emma did a really good job of getting the students engaged with this and they were all excited to get up to the board and get working. I liked the nature of the first activity and how there was a document sent out that had students working on finding different vocab terms (kind of jigsaw style). This is a really neat resources because she is having the students build a study sheet together that then they can come back and utilize in the future. Emma then moved into a worksheet over different topics that were talked about in class. The closer was a quick little check-in form and I liked how this was digital because it allowed students to answer more truthfully and everyone could give their input!,I think that Emma did a really good job of floating around the room while the students were working on small group/partner work activities. She was always available when students had a question or needed help.,"Since this was a worksheet-heavy session, the students had a tendency to turn to individual work, even though they were told to work with a partner when handed the worksheet. I know that this is very normal for students, but one of my favorite strategies is to give each pair only one worksheet, so that they are forced to work together instead of turning to work by themselves. After the session, the correct answers and completed worksheet can be shared with them so they don't feel like they are missing out on the handout. "," Emma did a really good job of redirecting questions and making sure that students understood all angles of the correct answer. I really liked her comment where said said ""I see that you guys got the right answer, but does anyone actually understand what this means and why it was correct?"" This way of forcing the students to elaborate on the topic and share everything that they knew was really creative and I liked it a lot. Simple comments like this go a long way!","Overall, this was a really great session! I think that Emma did a great job of planning a variety of activities and really harnessing the three pillars to make sure that her students understood all of the concepts thoroughly. Emma did a super awesome job!"
,"Opener: The game they played together is really nice; it got the students to open up and get talking before jumping into serious content.

Activities: Did a nice job of going through all of the practice problems and using wait time to cultivate more response from students, but can do a better job at checking for understanding. For example, having the students explain the topic to one another, even after the problem was solved.

Closer: Nice job reviewing what they went over. They should test for understanding again at the end.",The SI Leader fostered a comfortable and productive learning environment they were not disregarding any attempt at problems and getting student to think through problems as well even when they were stuck.,"The SI leader did a good job not just answering straight away, but also discussing why the students arrive at their conclusions. If the students do not arrive at the correct solution, trying to move them in another direction could be improved. Also, can ""hype up"" those students a bit more when they get it right.",Having them practice many questions and increasing the difficulty as they went from problem to problem to solidify their understanding. This gave the students lots of practice and exposure to many different issues they can see.,SI leader did great cultivating a good learning environment and had good content for students do to. Try implementing group work there was a lot of solo work that can done together and making group activity games involved with the content so they can get more interested and involved with that they are learning.
,"The opener was a random discussion. It gave the students a nice transition into the session and the following activities were clearly peer-led. The students were all active and attentive, although they often got sidetracked. The closer was a kahoot recap of the lecture with examples and practice questions for the students to do. I thought the kahoot was a nice touch as it was something that even I- with very little coding experience, could follow.","The SI leader has done a great job creating a comfortable and energetic environment, as the students are clearly comfortable being themselves during the session. 

","One thing the SIL could work on improving is keeping the session on track and reeling the students back in when they get sidetracked as they tend to go on a tangent, as well as having backup activities in case they planned activities take a shorter time than intended.
","The SIL clearly explained what the students were doing well while writing the code, and had the agenda projected on the screen for the students to see. The SIL also allowed the students room to figure out the answers for themselves and didn't step in whenever they were unsure. Chris did a very good job of facilitating a space of collaboration among the students.
","The students were easily distracted, but although they weren’t as focused, the SIL tried to keep them on track to offer a productive session. However, to improve productivity, I would suggest minimising the side conversations, or have a time put aside for random chats so the rest of the session could be used for the actual academic-related activities.
"
,Nice opener and closer where he tries to know his students better,"The session was a no show but according to the session plan the SI leader seems to give the students hints, show them easy examples to better learn concepts",Attendance. Most of the sessions are no show . He can make his emails and announcements in class more attractive to students e.g. arranging free snacks for students in session and tell them to walk in with their doubts about maths and get those solved with the help of the SI and their peers,"I liked the lesson contents he made, it could have been informative for students if they attended the session","Nice session plan and course content , it was interactive, informative to be used as efficient peer learning. Try making the emails and announcements more engaging to attract students . It’s great that the SI interacts with the students during workshop in the class but the student might get the benefit of SI inside class , making them reluctant to attend the actual SI session. Overall the SI leader seems to be really humble and helpful to the students ."
,"I think the opener was really fun! I haven't really used them in my session but I love any Wordle-ish games as openers.
The slideshow for the syscall discussion looked good.
The closer seems like a good way to focus on note taking strategies and give students an idea of what works for their peers.",N/A (no-show),"I don't have any ideas, I think that the session looks really well planned out and it had a variety of collaboration methods (mix of discussions as clusters/small groups and as a big group).",I think the activities this SI Leader had planned were really good and would be helpful based on how much we covered these topics in lecture. I really liked the syscall discussion slideshow. It looked good and I think it would be a helpful tool for leading the discussion.,"I think this session plan was really good! I liked the syscall discussion slideshow, it seems like it would be a good way to lead that discussion."
,"I liked this opener! It got everyone talking and working together and it was nice for them to see an example. 

Activity: multiple choice content quiz practice, they can use their notes but should do it on their own and then discuss with someone next to them. Went around during it and asked them to explain part of the question to check for understanding. I did not see them talk to another until after everyone was stuck and was guided to. They were told they could write it out on mini whiteboards, which is a good idea. The SI walked around facilitating between the two groups and asked how they were doing, what they got, and how. Did heads down and hands up for how confident people felt. 

Changed it to be group questions. Asked redirecting questions towards students who know the material more. Had them repeat how it was explained back to everyone. For one question they gave different people different markets and then had them go up to the corresponding part of it on the board that matched the markers colors.

Closer: K-W-L this is a great choice especially right before an exam because it allows the students to like brain dump what they learned and know what they need to focus on more. Also had students rate how they felt on a scale from 1-5.","Talked to them before the session, asked how they were doing. Had a fun opener with an example. Gave guidance and hints when they were stuck to help them break down the questions being asked (asked what precipitation is). The SI leader walked around the room, giving students encouragement and telling them that they are proud of them. ","I know this is a quiz review, and I'm not that familiar with college chemistry, but I think there could have been ways to do two different content activities still. Like a Kahoot or something on paper.

I also feel like a lot of the same people were answering or got called up to the boards. Everyone was participating in groups, but I think really pushing them out of their comfort zone would have benefited them.","I really liked the way you checked for understanding by asking them to define the thing they are trying to create using a combination of elements. Then, when they had the answer, you asked them to explain why they thought that to see how they got their answer. ","Great job!! I like the incentive that if they attend over 4 sessions, they get a bonus at the bonus exam. That is a nice way to make sure they don't just come to the sessions right before."
,"I like the opener simple and nice, good questions for breaking the ice. Overall, pretty good activities, I really like how the activity where they explained each other concepts that are assigned to them as a group. It was a good reflective closer as well, makes them think about what they learned this session.","When the first student came, the SI leader asked how their weekend went, which breaks the ice and talked a bit about movies together, which creates a comfortable environment for the student. When the second student came, he integrated the student pretty well into the activity they were doing.","When a student asks the SI leader a question, I feel like he could've redirected the question to the other student.","I like how he had a pretty good way of interacting with the NTID student, he wrote his guided answers for the student and helped him find the answer. He also urged the student to help each other to find the answer which is pretty good. ","Overall a great session! Maybe instead of saying ""does it make sense"", you could try saying ""do you have any questions about this {topic}"", so that it gives students a chance and space to ask further questions. "
,"Opener: matching game with facts to see what students understand about MVT and Rolle's Theorem. This was beneficial because it allowed the SI leader to ensure that they understood the content being covered today. 

Activities: 
1. Started with graphing - finding the secant line, and found other ""things"" on the graph. This was a really good activity and the students all worked on the questions together. 

Closer: Didn't have time to get to it, but was going tobe asking the students if they have any questions. ","SIL was really calm with the student and asked a lot of questions. Dawn never gave the students answers, but made sure to ask all students questions to make sure that they understood the material. ",Some of the students seemed to get a bit bored since it was mostly one person writing on the board while everyone else just watched. You could try getting more students involved by having them take turns writing or explaining their steps instead of the SIL doing most of it.,"checking for understanding - SIL did a really good job with making sure that the students understood the materials. 

redirecting questions - making sure that more than one person answer questions and writes things on board. This also allowed the students to make sure they understood the why behind the concept. ",SIL did a great job; it was a lovely session to be in. 
,"The opener was engaging and effective — the warm-up activity helped students get focused and ready to think critically. The use of the cheat sheet idea was creative and helpful, especially since the SI Leader modelled how to use it effectively. The activities were interactive and well-structured, with a good mix of understanding and higher-order thinking (HOT) questions. The closer was good, the SI Leader asked students feedback on what material do they need to go over for exam-2, so she can create exam review packet. ","The SI Leader interacted positively with students by asking frequent questions to check for understanding and by redirecting questions in a supportive way. They broke down complex concepts into smaller, manageable parts, which made it easier for students to grasp the material. Their approachable attitude and encouragement created a comfortable atmosphere where students felt confident participating and sharing their thoughts.","One area for improvement would be to walk around the room more while students are working. This would allow for more one-on-one interactions, help identify where students might be struggling, and keep everyone engaged during group activities.",The SI Leader did an excellent job structuring their questions to promote deep thinking. The balance between understanding questions and HOT (Higher Order Thinking) questions encouraged critical thinking and class participation. They also excelled at breaking down difficult topics so that all students could follow along.,"Overall, the session was well-organized, engaging, and student centred. The SI Leader demonstrated strong communication skills and created a positive, collaborative learning space. Continuing to move around the room and check in with different groups would make the sessions even more interactive and effective."
,I like the opener because it was an opening discussion about what everyone remembers from class. He did ask how everyone's weekend went but no one really talked about their weekend. ,"SIL asked his students how they're doing, if they did anything this weekend. He fostered a very comfortable environment. Everyone got into groups and seemed like they already knew each other. ",SIL could work on making more unique openers and closers. The opener and closer was just a discussion and they were pretty related to the class. I would plan an opener/closer with the goal of making them more fun. ,SIL was really good at helping his students when their stuck an appropriate amount. Also a strength of Haroon's is that he's very easy to talk to.,Plan a little more content for your sessions. We kind of ran out of stuff to do. 
,"Opener - SIL asked the student about how the felt their exam went. the student was open to talking about their struggles with the course and what thy felt comfortable with doing. (by this point there was one student but more people showed up over the course of the session)

Activities - the activites went very smooth and could be tailored to the specific student's need. A problem would be put on the board and the students had to manually write functions. each student had to contribute to the making of the code, and critique each other's answers.

Closer - Q and A, for the closer he asked the students if they had any questions about what they just went over and what is being done in the class. it was a simple closer that nicely followed the activities.","All the students felt comfortable talking with each other and collaborating on solving problems. SIL did a good job at making sure everyone contributed, and never felt bad about getting something wrong.","I would say that the one thing he could improve on is activity variety. This is something I also need to work on, and for specific subjects it is very challenging to find activities that work for the subject and also feel different to each other.",SIL was great with redirecting questions and giving students clear instructions.,"I would tell them the same thing that I felt they should improve on, more activity variety."
,The session was a little unique because one person showed up. The opener was sort of skipped or rather is was quick. It was going through some slides. This was a good review of course material. I think it would have been helpful to have the students involved in the opener. The activity was catered towards the individual student. This was a good idea. The activity was practice problems. The activity works well for any subject. 2 truths and a lie was a great closer. I learned a lot from that. ,The SI leader was very kind towards students and started the session with a fun fact which was nice to see. The student did seem quite comfortable. The SI leader also asked the student to come up to the whiteboard which fostered a productive learning environment. ,"I believe it would have been very useful after helping the student solve a problem to have explain their solution from the start and thoroughly. Almost like a presentation. For longer questions, sometimes the students forget how they got to where they are. ","I like the SI leader sometimes told the student to take a step back. This can be very useful if a student falls down a rabbit hole. I should do this more. It can be good to quickly correct a student if they're doing something wrong. This also saves time. This type of guidance is really helpful, your almost organizing your students thought process and catching them when it goes in the wrong direction.","I really liked the format you had for your session. You went through some brisk review for a minute or two where you did most of the talking. Then you had the student do a practice problem where you assisted them a lot. And then you sent them off on their own to do a problem and only ask for help when needed. This works well.. You are also a master of the content, its clear you understand it well. One thing that could improve is having the student explain their work or the solution more often. Or at least at the end. If there's a long, complicated problem that I'm helping a student solve, I like to ask them to explain the entire thing to me from the start. I judge a student's understanding of a topic based on how well they can present it. I find that to be very useful and it is something that would fit perfectly into your session. Another tip that might be useful is instead of telling them what they did wrong just circle it or allude to it. Sometimes that works wonder for their understanding of the topic.  "
,"The opener could have been more interactive, but it was a brain teaser, so we were pretty stumped. The activities that were content-based were good and allowed the student to show his skills. Closer was good and fun.",They made jokes with them and really allowed it to be peer-led. It also made sure they knew they can use their notes. ,Explaining the actual content. There was something he could have done differently or explained it in a way to make more sense. ,"Interacting with the students and maintaining focus on the topic, without straying from the content. He did well on getting both students to participate in the activities. ",Just explain things a little more. Be a little clearer on what you want them to do.
,"For the opener, SIL asked the students about what they want more practice on, which got the students talking. This is a good way to get feedback from the students and identify knowledge gaps. The main activities consisted of many calculus problems, finding local minima and maxima and approximating the graph of a function. The closer was super fun, guessing football players from a picture.","The students were very comfortable throughout the session. During problem solving, one person was always writing on the board, and the others were there to help if needed. SIL redirected questions, making sure that everyone was engaged. Wait time was also used, as a way to give students the time to think, without giving away the answer.","After finding the x values where the graphs were not defined, SIL could have demonstrated using a graph, that the slope is vertical at these point. This would help build intuition for the students.",SIL had the students research the mean value theorem and rolles theorem and explain it by sketching a graph and showing it to the other team.,"He could have prepared something more collaborative for the main activity. While one student was on the board, the others were sometimes side tracked or on their phones."
,"Very chill opener! They played a wikipedia game in small groups. Class content braindump, Isaac asked them to the recall what they did in class and he would write down when they said on the board making a small concept map/flow chart. The braindump into a discussion on the material was done very well as it built off of the knowledge the students were lacking. Great use of the smaller white boards! The room was set up very well fro a group discussion.",The students and the seemed to be very comfortable working together and collaborating on activities! Isaac actively included everybody in the activities even those more reserved. Isaac congratulated them on their correct answers and redirected questions to the rest of the students when they needed a little help!,"Maybe let the students use the markers more instead of writing all of the students ideas yourself. Also, just be more careful with the time you have for each session and make sure you don't go over! Aside from this everything else was very well done!",Isaac did a great job with his redirecting questions and giving the students enough time to think about their answer before answering (Wait time). You did a very good job on calling on the students that weren't as openly participating to make sure everyone participates in the activity. I like the way you used variations of the questions to started with to check the students understanding for specific scenarios!,Great session overall! I love your use of the group discussion strategy to get everyone participating! You had great wait time and redirecting question to other students. You created a great environment for the students to learn and comfortably share their ideas! I liked your way of checking for understanding by asking the groups questions about different problem scenarios. The only things I would try to improve are letting your students lead te session a little more by giving them the marker and and being more mindful of the clock! Great job! 
,"Opener - I love spotle! Such a great opener to get the students to think, and it also got me a little involved as well lol. I will definitely steal this for one of my sessions.

Activities  - List comprehension: I don't know much about comp sci, but I liked that he got the students up and working on the whiteboard
  Kahoot: great way to test their knowledge and ensure they understand the topics covered!
Practice questions: backup activity in case the other activities were to go faster. Great way to reassess their knowledge! I liked that he had it ready to go rather than scrambling for another activity to do before the closer.

Closer - They ran out of time for the closer, but they had great practice of the content and conversations about the class!","Very welcoming with his students! Before the session even started, he got the students to talk about their classes, the exam they had, which sparked up conversations between him and the students. The students aren't afraid to ask questions, and when a question is asked, he uses his redirecting skills before answering the question himself. He also made sure the students understood the topics covered by asking further questions and playing games to test their knowledge.",It was a great session! Not really much to say otherwise :p ,"Great activities and a great job redirecting questions and assessing their knowledge! Also, I like that he had extra activities planned in case the other ones went faster than expected.",n/a :)
,I like how the SIL was able to immediately gauge the level of understanding from the opener and keep it in mind when continuing with the other activities. I also liked how during the activities he kept asking questions to provoke thought and would redirect questions when appropriate. He managed a balance of having the students work by themselves and work together. He did this by having them take turns or describe the code written by another student. ,"The SI Leader started off the session with a writing down things you know, which helps allow him and the students to feel the environment of learning. He continuously upkept this environment by asking questions and giving students a launching point for the activities by writing a few lines of code or defining the goal of a function","I felt the SI Leader was a bit more lecturing than student led collaboration, however It was clear on some of the topics the students did not know the topic very well if at all, so It worked in the end.",The SIL did a great job at helping the students feel more confident by redirecting questions and ask questions to the students when necessary,"Amazing Session, I could really tell how helpful you are to the students. The agenda on the board gave clear and distinct information about what the session is going to entail. I also enjoyed how the students got involved and your questions to them seemed to be exactly what they needed to give the full answer, but without your question giving any information. The opener was a great way to gauge the level of understanding of the students!"
,"I think the activities were a bit same-y, being just ""answer what this code does"" in the same format. Understandably it was more of a review session, but I think it might be more interesting to have different ways to check for the students' understanding. Though if that's what the students like, then that's fine.","There was only one student so it's a bit hard to comment on how he would conduct a group session, but I like that he's able to form a connection with the student and chat with them right before the session and then moving into the classroom with them. He seemed to match with the student's mood and personality well.","He could consider coming up with activities that are more collaborative in nature, so anything that requires there to be at least 2 people working together.","I think he did well with checking for understanding, which seems to be the main theme of the session. The activities were definitely meant to probe for their understanding, and he was also often asking student small chunks of questions.",N/A
,"Steven’s opener was really engaging. By asking about the exam that happened today, he built an immediate connection with the students and made a welcoming tone for the session. The activities were very nice in my opinion as tthe students were really engaged and weren’t afraid to ask questions. The closer was a great way to wrap things up and check in on where the students are after the session.","Great use of wait-time by Steven, he dropped hints to guide students toward the answer when clearly the students are getting no where. He also drew visual python lists that directly related to the topics students struggled with on the exam, and he used gentle redirection to get participation from everyone.","This is a small nitpick, but I would recommend writing the agenda on the board just in case some students arriving late know what’s happening. ","Steven did an really good job adapting to what the students needed in the moment. His use of visuals, guiding questions, and wait time show he was really paying attention to where students were getting stuck and adjusting his approach to support them.","Very nice session overall. You created a supportive learning environment, kept students engaged, and responded thoughtfully to their questions. Your sessions are clearly helping students feel more confident with the material."
,"Opener: Derivative Rules practice
Good to drill these. I wonder if it's worth the time though if the students are confident with this. Have you seen your students improve their recall over the semester doing this repeatedly? 

Activity: Concept Map
Write conditions for two theorems
Didn't always catch student's mistakes or was confusing e.g. allowing 'f(x) is continuous on (-inf, inf) therefore...' while MVT does not need continuity on (-inf, inf) 
Good guided questions, Rolle's theorem difference to MVT
Asking students to refer to notes is good 
I feel like you could have had the student do more work like when explaining using graphs

Activity: Continuity Review
Good connection to this material. Students def need review of this unit during MVT study.
Letting students work through their thought process is good 
Allowed students to cross-check answers and helped after they didn't catch mistakes
I think you could allow students to draw graphs/etc. 
Time sensitively moves on that's good

Activity: Practice Problems
Allowed students to work out solutions on their own 
Pretty good collaboration between your students ","Casual interaction & small talk throughout the start 
Asking about confidence in the class/struggles is always helpful to make students feel comfortable
Students comfortable joking around","Allowing students to work through their thinking on more theoretical parts like theorems or conclusions (where c goes, what cot is, unit circle)",Fostering collaboration between students and allowing them to think during work and also managing activities/timing was great,Super good work! Great session
,"The opener was ""birds"" and she had her 2 students draw on the board. The students seemed like they were having fun for they were giggling the whole time.

For the main activity, I like how she asked her students whether they want to practice graphs or equations. That way she hits the areas that the students need the most. She was prepared for both. I think she did a great job of having students think through the problems, instead of just giving them answers.

Sydney ended with wordle. It's a fun New York Times Puzzle game and it was a great way to destress after the sessions.","Sydney started the session by simply asking her students how their day went. I thought this was a great way to bond with her students. She was very attentive throughout the activities, she stood right next to her students. She was always available but she never did the work for them.",N/A,"She asked great guided questions, to get students to explain their reasoning for the steps that they took.",Great Job!
,"Opener - Good review, got the student involved in review in a gamified way

Activities - Rapid-fire multiple-choice questions were great to review conceptual material followed by whiteboard code to solidify practical knowledge. I think this was an excellent template to follow and transitions smoothly

Closer - Left time at the end for personal questions as well as a checking for understanding section",The SI leader redirected questions excellently and tried their best to make the student feel comfortable tackling concepts they didn't understand very well. ,"Wait time could be expanded upon, like letting the student try to figure out the answer before simplifying or giving it to them","Writing an agenda is a very practical as well as whiteboard coding to make sure the student understands the code on a conceptual level instead of just practically. 

The leader also left ample time to review any topics the students might have to make for a more tailored session. ","It's tricky dealing with students who might not know certain concepts and at times you might want to just give an answer so you can move on with your session. I'd suggest maybe trying to simplify certain questions or giving examples they might be familiar with to try and nudge them in the right direction. 

Overall, the session was great and I think leaving enough time at the end was a phenomenal move as it's something I struggle with myself. "
,"No opener or closer for this session.
Love triangle - a math problem centered around a love triangle involving planes. Some planes only like other kinds of planes and the students had to calculate if there were any love triangles in the group. 4 students came up to the board and were doing a nice job writing individually but also helping each other. 2 other students stayed in their seats. This took about 30 minutes so I'm not sure there was an opener.
Kahoot - (3 students left before this) There was a long pause before starting this activity and I was a little confused about what was going on or if the session was over. There were definitely some missed opportunities to redirect questions and check for understanding.","Chris did a great job working with students and encouraging them while they were working. They clearly like him and everyone was joking around. Definitely a positive and fun, yet productive environment. ","No agenda on the board- I walked in 1 minute late and didn't know what was going to happen. Also making the two students who were just sitting participate more. It seems like they knew the material, but they should be participating more actively if they're attending SI. ",Chris had a good balance of having students figure things out independently and knowing when to step in and redirect them. ,I think Chris could benefit from being a little more assertive and organized in session. Students seemed to sort of just be doing what they wanted. The session seemed somewhat helpful for students but I didn't see much of the SI model being used. 
,The opener (Guess the Movie) was strong but definitely made for a larger group. The first activity (Create a Map) was really good at incorporating the content of using graphs to find concavity and the students had little to no difficulty understanding how to do the activity. The second activity (Find Your Treasure) allowed Jhoelle to take time to clear up concerns that another student had while the other was able to work at a somewhat faster pace.,"Jhoelle has a great relationship with her students, making it easy for them to start engaging in conversation and ready to dive into the activities. Some of the student's conversations might create distractions from the content, but Jhoelle does an awesome job redirecting the students back to the activities.","Potentially consider letting the students use their notes when using specific terms (points of inflection, critical points, concave up/down, etc). This would make sure they are demonstrating the material correctly or able to fill in any definitions they might gain during the session. Also don't worry about not getting to another activity if the students seem to be struggling on the current one!","Jhoelle did a great job keeping the student's engaged and focused on the material. If a student had a question, she did a really great job of utilizing it to check for understanding and have another student answer the question. I also liked the range of activities and that there seemed to be no wait/set up time taking away from the session. ",Don't be afraid to not get to an activity if the students want to focus/have questions on the one you are currently working on (essentially don't rush). You can always reuse an unused activity in a following session!
,No opener but wrote activities on boards. activities were very collaborative and involved all students. ,Yes he has a very good relationship with students they were able to stay on task and be productive ,Possibly having an opener to segue into math topics. Also when they were going in the wrong direction he took a but long to say something so maybe saying something or asking a question to help them realize their mistake.,Good at redirecting questions and asking for explanations on the steps they took to solve the problem ,"Overall, very good session! "
,"I thought the opener was a fine opener, it got the people engaged and talking with each other. I think the activates were good, with a good mixture between busy-work for the students to collaborate together, doing individual work for the students, and facilitation from the SI leader. It was a mixture of sheet-handouts, board work, and a sort-of slides gameshow. The closer worked well in ensuring the session was closed and still gave students ample time to work with the SI leader.","They were actively engaged with the students, handed out material, ensured that all students were included and encouraged people to talk with one another, and gave plently of time for questions and help.",I think there may be better opportunities for redirecting questions when going over the answers to material.,I think they did really nicely in ensuring the students had everything they needed related to the activities and had excellent report with making a comfortable environment.,"I think it was a really good SI session, it's obvious that the students had a good time and were comfortable and included. It also seemed they had a good rapport with you, and I think had a fantastic time with a positive impact."
,"I like the opener, infinite craft is always fun. For the activities, the students collaborated well. I like that the SI leader had the students explain their work, this was a good check for understanding. I love having the students come up with companies and then debate which category they're in - it was great for collaboration and also applying what they've learned to real world scenarios. The closer was fun, too",The SI leader was personable and created a fun environment which made the students comfortable and able to to collaborate well.,"I can't think of anything to improve, I think the SI leader did a overall great job.",Great redirecting questions. Great checking for understanding of the other student when one of the students gave the answer.,"The SI leader did a really great job of getting the students to collaborate, especially in the sorting the companies activity, which got the students debating, strengthening their understanding. I think it would seem hard to make interactive activities for a class like econ, but the SI leader did a great job with this."
,The opener was very frustratingly fun. I was losing my mind slightly but I was able to solve the Pips game with SIL. The activities seem like they would have been good for the students. Sophia was able to walk me through process scheduling activity where I had no prior knowledge. The closer would have been rose bud thorn which would have been great for Sophia to gauge where her students knowledge. ,SIL fostered a comfortable learning environment by bring in Irin who came earlier for her session to try and participate in the closer. Sophia was good at allowing me and Irin to attempt the Pip on our own without much input from her. I believe she would have does this effectively if she did have students show up. ,"I believe the SI Leader could improve on her attendance. I understand that she just had an exam and it is snowing, but she did say she typically only has one regular. I believe is she used an incentive, maybe candy, to try and motivate the regular to bring a friend that may help her attendance.","The SI Leader did a good job at redirecting questions, Irin (who is taking the course SIL supports currently) came earlier for her SI session was able to understand the material more than me. Sophia did a good job asking questions to learn what Irin knows as they have different professors. Sophia also did a good job at teaching me from scratch. Sophia is a great teacher even if the students have little to no knowledge about the subject. ",The general feedback I have is to not discouraged with having a no show. I have had many no shows in the past. The key is to keep trying and talking with students to find out how to plan sessions around their needs. I have tailored my openers and closers to the interest of my students and that may be something to consider if you have not done so already. You are a great teacher SIL!
,I thought the activities were interesting and informative,I thought the atmosphere was generally low stress,I feel like we could have used a little more help on syntax stuff,Generally used the facilitation methods very effectively,Nothing I didn't share in person. Great job!
,"Opener - The opener was a fun and interactive activity which served as a good warm-up going into the session. The opener also encouraged discussion among the SI leader and student

Activities - The first activity was a good and relatable premise, which was fun and creative, incorporating the class topics into the activity. The SI leader discussed the activity’s problems with the student well, helping them to find the answer without giving the full answer directly. In addition to giving explanations of the concepts to the student, the SI leader used some simple example problems to help the student understand the basics of the question. After the activity, the SI leader gave a quick summary of what areas the student can improve upon based on the problem. The second activity was a bit shorter due to time constraints. This activity did a good job of building on concepts introduced in the first activity. While shorter, this second activity still felt like a good way for the student to study some of the course content. 

Closer - The closer was another online game, which was a fun way to end the session, keeping the student engaged, while winding down from the more intense academic portion of the session. 
","The environment felt casual and friendly, while still being one focused on learning. The SI leader would discuss questions with the student openly, rather than relecturing or speaking over them. The SI leader would also give the student adequate time to solve the problem on their own, giving feedback and observations about the student’s work as needed.  ","The SI leader gave some longer verbal explanations of concepts which could be improved by adding a visual aid, such as drawing on the whiteboard. For instance, when discussing the second derivative test, the concept was a bit hard to visualize without an aid, due to the topic's heavy use of graphing concepts. ","The SI leader had a good back-and-forth with the student, keeping up the energy throughout the session. The SI leader was able to have a good conversation with the student regarding the session topics, and it was clear that the student was engaged throughout the session. The SI leader also knew how to give answers and explanations that the student would understand, which was great for tailoring the session to the student’s needs","The session seemed fairly fun and engaging, and the activities were all good at incorporating course content. The SI leader did a good job at managing their time, so that the majority of activities could be completed within the session time. The SI leader had a good rapport with the student, giving the session a welcoming and friendly atmosphere. Overall, the SI leader did a good job of being prepared for the session, with fun activities and relevant content. One area of improvement could be on incorporating visual aids into longer explanations of topics. An area of strength the SI leader demonstrated was a cultivation of a good learning environment. The student was clearly comfortable with the SI leader and was also engaged in learning the course materials. "
,"Even though the session ended up being a no-show, I thought the overall session plan was thoughtful and creative. The opener using Pokémon Showdown was engaging and connected well to real world applications of classes and methods. The planned activities of sorting traits/actions/names into classes, spotting errors in code, and reviewing commonly missed midterm questions were all nice activities in my opinion. The activities really good at checking for understanding and had the students work together. The closer was simple, but I really liked that he asked students for feedback on the previous exam prep so he can improve the next one.","Because there were no students present, there was no interaction this session. However, with Zifeng's explanation of his session plan, I could tell he would interact with the students in a very friendly and welcoming way. He used partner work, group discussion, and hands-on activities, which shows that he intended to create an inclusive and peer-supported session.     ","I think one thing the SI Leader could work on improving is to improve marketing strategies to get more students to the sessions. I see that he tried to use the java tokens to get more students, but there was still a no show. I think maybe he could write the times and dates of the sessions on the whiteboard if he isn't already doing so or try to have the instructor help market the sessions.","Zifeng created a highly engaging session plan. The activities were interactive, aligned with course content, and it also encouraged students to think about classes, methods, and common errors. I think he made a really engaging session plan and the activities.","Your session plan is creative, thoughtful, and designed with student learning in mind. Even though no one attended today, the session plan showed that you prepared and an understanding of collaborative SI techniques. Keep developing interactive activities like these (especially Pokémon showdown). You should also consider strategies to increase attendance so more students can benefit from the work you’re putting in."
,The session began with the SI leader talking about the most recent exam. The students were immediately responsive and enthusiastic to talk about it. It seems that there is a good connection being made between the SI leader and the students that come to their sessions. The student knew exactly which questions they had and the SI leader went through the solutions asking questions and checking for understanding along the way.,The students seemed actively engaged. The student felt that they were able to speak freely about both what they understood and what they struggled on. The SI leader then responded with questions or prompts to make them understand what they had done wrong instead of just giving them the answer. The speech was productive and there was no time wasted. The SI leader spoke kindly and let the student do most of the talking or leading of the conversation.,"The SI can improve on the presentation on certain questions or explanations. The students found themselves forgetting things that were previously briefly mentioned, but these weren’t written down. The explanations given could also be improved by having something written down while explaining so the students can have a visual along with the instructions.",The SI leader provides their students with a lot of review materials outside of the classroom and session time. There we’re provided study guides for the exam as well as provided solutions to any questions or problems that were gone over during the session time.,"Overall the session went really well, the students seem really happy to attend and there seems to be a really nice community being created with this SI Leader. The only things I would think to improve upon is presentation of materials, ideas or questions. As the resources around you like whiteboards, paper or computers can be used to make sure the students can understand what you are saying, not just hear it."
,"I think the opener, kwl chart, would have provided a great start for students to identify common struggles amongst their classmates and can also serve as an icebreaker for students(though only one student attended). The activities were also very helpful in that they provided extra practice problems for students to review old materials such as computing long divisions and performing checks using D * Q + R. I also liked the kahoot closer as it's always a more entertaining method to let students practice solving mcq questions in a short amount time, in which I find was a great way to help improve students' problem solving time on real exams.","In one of the activity, where students were supposed to partner up with each other and take turns to solve a problem, Eddy was able to host this activity by acting as the partnering student when only one student showed up. Without giving direct hints or answers, Eddy asked guiding questions such as what concept are we supposed to apply when solving this type of problem and helped the student complete the problems very quickly. It also seemed that the student did not treat Eddy like a teacher and more like a real peer during that activity. ","The SI leader can try to make his activities more entertaining. The session environment felt very similar to a classroom where students just solve math problems and leaves. I think that in future sessions, the SI leader can include real world applications of the class materials or design problems in a game-style to motivate students to be more engaged.",The SI leader was definitely very helpful in guiding students to master topics. The problems introduced in the session covered all class materials and were more difficult than practice questions from the lecture. The SI leader also checked for understanding by asking students to solve a similar problem with different values and explain their thought process from the start.,"Overall, the session offered a very productive and comfortable environment. The student reflected the effectiveness of the SI leader's activities through coming in not knowing how to solve many of the in-class problems to being able to handle higher level questions by themselves after the session. However, more different methods and marketing techniques can be implemented to make students feel more engaged to participate in the sessions such as marketing materials and more entertaining math activities."
,"Overall, I think the session is great. SI leader had students go up to the whiteboard and do practice problems, and had the student walk him through the questions. Most of the time students were leading the SI leaders and explain his thought process. ","I like that the SI Leader used Thanksgiving as an opener, and how he acted just like another student in the class, solving problems together with the student. ",SI leader can work on incorporating more checking for understanding in the session. ,"I like how SI leader have the student refer back to his note when he's struggling, instead of just giving off answers. ","Overall, I think you did a great job at fostering a comfortable learning. I also like you have student go to the whiteboard and handed him the markers to do the practice problem, which made the student more involved in the materials. "
,"The opener was really fun and collaborative. The main activities had great content and collaboration. And the closer was a nice, easy way to finish the session.","SIL has a great connection with her students; they all get along and work well together most of the time. I think the students take advantage of that relationship to get off track, but Jasmin is pretty good at getting them back on track.",Maybe use a little more wait time and redirect the question to other students. And make the Agenda a little more descriptive.,"She did a great job creating a fun, collaborative environment where all the students get along! Both main activities covered the topics that will help the students succeed on the quiz and exam content!",Keep it up!🐐
,"The opener was a check in google form, it went well I am not sure what was on it however I assume it had to do with possibly how a student feels about the course perhaps. Next was a brain dump activity on content that they went over in class. After that they went into practice problems that had to do with L'Hospitals Rule. Ending was higher or lower.","Aditya, did a great job interacting with the student. The student seemed to be a regular, and had even said that he attended 13 sessions which is pretty good. They seemed to have a pretty good relationships occasionally making jokes while keeping the session on topic.","I would say one thing you could improve on is wait time, it seemed that they were a little quick to answer some questions however, it is only one person so that may be a little more difficult which I understand.",I would say the activities. The activities were short enough to go through them while connecting them together. And also being able to communicate well with the student and be able to have a fun and productive session.,"Great job! You seem to have the SI pillars down, and a great checking for understanding, as he could tell the student was strong on this part of the session, so decided to switch to material the student was weaker with to get more practice."
,"The opener was spotle which was a great activity to keep the students engaged. The activities included having the students write what they know about the topic which was a great way to introduce the topic and have the students to start thinking on their own. I liked the matching activity because it allowed the students to collaborate on deciding which symbols relating to what definition and their units. I could appreciate that the session was planned on a slideshow so the activities flowed and the session was very efficient in getting practice, but also allowing the students to collaborate and have fun. The closer was a question posed to the students and i thought that was a good touch since it related to studying and some students could benefit from getting new ideas when studying.","The SIL allowed the students to work together to find solutions, but also stepped in when necessary to guide them when they were confused. The SIL also encouraged the students and corrected them when they spoke negatively. The students were comfortable working in the session and interacted well with the SIL. The SIL also periodically did a temperature check of the room to see how the students were feeling about the topic.","The SIL could share the answers with the students before moving on to the next question, that way the student can compare the real answer side by side to what they did so they'll be able to correct any mistakes made. This could also build their confidence. I would also say to have less wordy slides, or have the slides on the screen long enough for the students to not just read but to allow what they read to soak in before changing the slides.",The SIL did a great job of guiding the students to figure the solution out themselves instead if just telling them the answer. The SIL did a great job making use of wait time and redirecting questions during the session to ensure all the students participated.,"Overall it was a good session and I enjoyed it. The content was relevant and you did a great job correcting the students without stepping in too much. I also liked that there were reminders at the end of the session, and the session ended on time."
,Jesse had an interesting opener that introduced the concept (indeterminate forms) in an interesting way. ,"Jesse has a very welcoming environment for his students. In todays session, only one student came, but they talked about the other regulars that they usually see at his sessions. Along with that, they talked about shared experiences in the classroom, which implies that Jesse's relationship with them extends beyond the SI Session, which contributes to the unique interactions they have. ",Jesse is sometimes a little too quick when providing help. In the future he could probably use more wait time. ,Fostering a comfortable and welcoming environment for the students to participate in.,"Great atmosphere, could potentially push his students more by providing less help. Overall great session. "
,"Opener: 
Opener was ok, student did not seem interested but SI instructor tried there best to get the student to work through binary operations which can have a good warming up affect before jumping into math content.

Activities:
Brain dump activity was good gave the student a way to remember and review what was done in class because they said they did not remember. SI instructor did a good job with good more in depth with content and getting the student to understand topic more deeply. Content practice was good to go through what the student did not know.

Closer:
Closer was a good wrap up with Wikipedia run.",SI leader worked with well with a student who seemed disinterest but made the student feel safe to answers questions and speak there mind.,SI leader did well with here activities but student did not have laptop or paper so maybe provided or projecting on the screen would help engage the student more rather then watch leader write on whiteboard.,Keeping a disinterested student engaged in the session.,"Did very well, try and get more people if possible to cultivate a better environment and use projector if possible for students without any materials. "
,"I found the opener and closer activity more of an energy check than an activity involving collaboration to break ice between students as basic questions where asked like plans for break and finals. I like the activities the well-designed ,informative for the student learn outside the class","No show. But as per the SI and I discussed ,the SI seems to guide students with easy examples and hints during learning activities",The SI could have included the activities to have a part where the students can take a look back on the activities done in class so that they don't feel lost while solving the activities like they do as per the SI  ,The course content activity on power point was really standard exam-like questions,"Nice session, really informative for the students to learn the course"
,"They go well together; the problems are very digestible, and its a nice idea to have a brain dump that is class-specific (sometimes makes them say more). Making their own formula sheets is a really fun closer idea!","Not sure, no show, but we did discuss it briefly and everything seems as it should; they intend to ask them to check their notes, employ wait times, discuss study strategies, and simplify the question instead of giving a hint (which I find to be a cool idea).",Try out a powerpoint instead of a document; looks nicer and there's more potential when presenting to students/sharing on the larger scale.,"The activities are super fun and varied (brain dump opener, formula cheat sheet closer), I love, unfortunate we didn't get to see them in action. ",Keep up the activities (especially the opener and closer!!) and test out powerpoints/slideshows! They don't work for everyone for sure but you never know aha
