After the hangman activity (where SIL held the marker the whole time and the students guessed the word), some of the students asked questions about the class, and the students left. ","You did a really good job learning and using students’ names, which made the session feel more personal. The atmosphere was great, and students seemed comfortable participating. I liked how you used candy as an incentive; it was a fun way to market and get students engaged. You also redirected questions really well to get students thinking, and you gave good wait time so they had space to work through their answers.","It would help to make the opener and closer more clear, since the session felt like it started a bit abruptly and ended without a clear wrap-up. Putting the agenda on the board at the beginning would also give students a sense of what to expect.

One of the main areas for improvement is making the session more collaborative. For example, instead of running the hangman game yourself, you could have students create the words and quiz each other. Another simple change would be letting students take turns holding the marker rather than keeping it yourself. This would encourage more active participation and make the session feel more student-led.

I also noticed that most of the participation came from one student (in the red shirt), while the other two were focused on other work. You can always remind students to stay engaged and try to draw them in by asking them directly or by assigning them small roles during the activity."

Another thing I really loved is that you didn't make your students feel bad or feel embarrassed if they didn't know the material. You were super patient with the girl in the red sweater when she totally didn't understand atomic orbitals - really great job redirecting to the rest of the students and allowing them to continue that conversation together. I can tell that your students aren't afraid to mess up or make mistakes and that is a true testament to you as a person and how you run your sessions.",Girl I literally got nothing LOL this was an amazing session!!

,PHOTO TECHHHH,Full observation,,,,Yes,Yes,"SIL started off with a game of guess who! This was a fun game where the students got to write down fun facts about themselves on notecards, and then they mixed them up and tried to guess which fact matched each person.","Group discussion, Clusters",Promoted collaboration,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Strengths: The room was arranged in table groups when I came in which is great for collaboration! SIL has such a friendly and kind vibe and I can tell that her students feel comfortable to ask her questions and participate, which they did. She did a longer opener today, but set a great boundary for the students for how much time they could take on it before they moved on - which I think is super important because the opener that she did was super fun and sometimes it can take a lot of effort to get students to start focusing on content. The two main activities SIL did was a worksheet and make-a-quizlet. The students and SIL did the first half of the worksheet together, then the students finished it in their table groups and went over it altogether. The make-a-quizlet activity is SO great for photo tech - the students did this in clusters and it is awesome because it lets them literally make their own study resource while in session that they can refer back to later. 

Improvements: There were only 9 students present, and sometimes with lower numbers, it makes it more awkward to walk around, but I do think she could have been a little more active, especially when going over the worksheet. Something I liked to do when I was a SIL was sit on one of the tables or just stand away from the podium in general when going over worksheets! This helped me feel more involved and not like I was lecturing the material to the students, so maybe this is something she could try.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Strengths: SIL did great incorporating the one student that came in late!! She caught them up right away and had them pull up a chair to one of the tables. The balance between her and SIL was also really strong throughout the session - they were bouncing off of each other and it was great to see. She knows and used most of the students' names (I think there were a few new people and the students were a little unsure who each other were). She did great with this though, reminding students of each other's names.

Improvements: Kind of going off of my last sentence, SIL is on the quieter side, so it is definitely a little easier for Audrey to kind of take control of the session if the students get distracted or start side conversations. I know this will come with time, but I would like to see SIL taking charge a little bit more of her sessions!! Having a co-lead is great because you can lean on each other throughout the session, but I want to encourage her to be more confident and own her sessions! Also, I think that sometimes when students are having a hard time with the material, it can really help to almost OVER praise them for their contributions. It didn't seem like she had any students who were 100% lost, but this was just kind of a general comment for future sessions because the material will get really confusing later in the semester. ",11,They played Quizlet live with the Quizlet they just made in their table groups! So much fun and such a great way to keep the session flowing. ,"This was a super chill session and you did really well!! You presented the material to the students in a non-stressful way that also allowed for a lot of collaboration, within the worksheet and also when they made their own quizlet. You also had such great energy throughout the session and the students definitely matched that. Your sessions have been super strong so far and I have loved reading your paperwork; I can't wait to see how much you grow throughout the semester!!","Being super nitpicky because you did awesome - you could use the students' names a little more! They all seemed really comfortable so this wasn't a huge issue but it just helps them feel more welcomed when you use their names directly. One thing I also noticed is that while you were reviewing the TOD worksheet with them, you tended to stand behind the podium a lot. Even just sitting on the table next to the podium or something like that can help make reviewing the worksheet less lecturey and more like a conversation - like you're all just casually talking about TOD together! LOL if that makes any sense. Overall such a good job though!!"

I would also suggest writing the agenda in more detail - for my sessions I'll write ""opener"" and then provide a few words description of what the opener is.

The students were spread out across tables which doesn't promote discussion. I am unsure if it was the intent, but the first activity ran for the entire session and no other activities from the agenda were done. There is nothing wrong with that since this was a review for the exam and the students may have needed it to fully understand the content, but more activities in the future will allow students to see different ways to learn the material.

Areas of Strength:
During the Kahoot, the SIL had the students explain their answers (whether right or wrong) to check for understanding. Also, when students asked questions, he made sure to first ask if anyone else knew the answer or could explain things (good redirection). To make sure all students participate, he directed some of his questions to specific students and used their names.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,Unsure,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,"Areas of Improvement:

Areas of Strength:
The students sometimes answered questions without being prompted which shows that they were comfortable in the session. Also, all the newcomers were immediately and effectively integrated into the session without stopping everyone else. ",4,The session went overtime so he started one of the other activities for the students. He had them complete a quick coding problem in pairs.

She did a great job asking the students additional questions to check for understanding after each problem.

* Used wait time effectively, giving time for the student to think
Check for understanding was phenomenal. The content was very well laid out to be student-led, allowing them to think through the content in their own way, and they went through ""what-if"" scenarios to verify their understanding.

* Specifically, I really liked how the SI handled the code examples. When the student was confused, the SI broke the code down into multiple sections and went piece by piece instead of just giving the answer. The SI acted more like a guide in place of a lecturer.  

* Went through study tips for an exam and was very reassuring

* Could maybe use some more redirecting  

* It might help to have the student walk through an example before jumping into code. For example, when doing sum(n) have them write out sum(5) first, then write the code.

My recommendation would be to pair up people before the kahoot and make them work together on only one device.","Make sure to double check your kahoot answers are correct!

You asked a lot of questions to hint towards the answer but not many redirecting one student's questions to the group.

Areas of Strength:
During the Kahoot, the SIL asked the student to explain their answers or asked questions related to the solution after each question (great check for understanding).

You do a really nice job leading the session with confidence, which makes the environment feel structured and supportive. You do a great job at redirecting questions to the students, such as when you asked them to work through the stoichiometry problem. That encourages participation and makes students think critically. You also make an effort to learn students’ names, and the name tents are a great touch to build connection. I like your use of the mini whiteboards-they’re very effective for collaboration and keep everyone engaged.","An area of improvement is wait time, you tend to jump in quickly with feedback and comments, but giving students a few extra seconds to process could help them develop their understanding more fully. An extra tip is you could also be making use of the large movable boards in the room. Having students stand and work in bigger groups could encourage even more interaction and teamwork. "

In particular, I liked how the first half served as a refresher and the second half worked as a comprehensive check for understanding, with a gradual increase in difficulty that built on prior material.

* The closing check-in on exam readiness is a great strategy to get to understand how your students feel about an upcoming exam and find out what topics you might want to cover. The SI could maybe incorporate some more into this section. For example, a Google form to get people's feelings anonymously, and or could incorporate a discussion on possible study habits.  

* The SI is very self-reflective and has adopted the SI model well. During the mock activity, all facilitation strategies were used.

* Marketing is solid, but could be strengthened by promoting sessions in the lab to the entire class and incorporating a possible reward system. What really stood out to me was that the SI is already engaging with, building connections, and promoting SI outside of class time, which is fantastic to hear. ","During coaching the SI brought up plenty of ideas. In specific, they felt it was hard to find old SI material for session ideas.

She won't give additional materials as incentive for session attendance because they already have ungraded homeworks that they don't do.
She speaks with the professor about what to focus/how to focus on topics during the session when she has any confusion or wants guidance.
We discussed a student who isn't participating in group activities. I suggested trying to speak with them about it and remind them to participate in the activities and address any concerns they might have. Also, using a group-based activity for the opener or closer might create a more comfortable environment in which they might feel more at-ease participating in.
Altogether, she's doing great with marketing and reaching out to students. My only suggestion is that she check in with more students in the class either in-person or through a form to see what they want out of the sessions or why they aren't coming to sessions now.

",2,Recap / Check in,"* Used all facilitation strategies well. In particular, checking for understanding via two students by having one create an example, then the other solve it.

* If the wait time or the redirect doesn't work, the SI would have them go through their notes, which promotes good note-taking and allows them to find a template they can use for problems.

* The SI was very reassuring, excited, and approachable.

* Throughout the session, the SI used a variety of learning methods, such as whiteboard and paper activities, and introduced many ways to interpret the information, such as visually with the number line or metaphorically, such as bleach on a carrot. Even the idea of showing a dance to remember the sign flip was extremely clever to help them remember.

* I think my favorite thing has to be the use of the boardwalk model. It showed the students a study habit and centered the session around it. At the start, the SI asked what areas they felt comfortable and not so comfortable in, which is a great way to adjust your session as needed, i.e, focus on areas the students are struggling with more than others. Then, on top of that, the model allows them once again to internalize the information in many ways (example/template, core knowledge, the math steps, and the ""narrative steps"")",Nothing too much to say here

,MATH-171,Full observation,,,,Yes,Yes,SIL did the Wordle for his opener - a classic.,Group discussion,Promoted collaboration,Yes,Somewhat,No,Yes,Somewhat,Somewhat,,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Strengths: SIL had a really strong session despite only having one student. It can be hard when you plan for collaborative activities and only have one student show up, but he did a great job adapting his session. Joe did a function vs constant activity that I really enjoyed. He would put a function or constant up on the board and the student had to move to a side of the room based off of if they thought it was a function or constant. I liked that this activity was active! It got the student up and moving and I can definitely see how it would be fun with more students - they would have to debate their answers if they disagreed and it would be a good way to check for understanding. 

Improvements: It is tricky to have only one student show up! It makes it a lot harder to redirect questions and doesn't leave a lot of room for collaboration but I think Joe did a really good job adapting to this. A suggestion I have for Joe is to utilize wait time a little more. The student tended to ask him many questions and Joe often answered them right away, which kind of makes sense because the student definitely wanted an answer right away. Wait time is hard because it can feel awkward, but it gets students in the habit of not expecting an answer right away.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,"Strengths: I loved SIL's relationship with the student that attended!

I also really liked how you had the girl explain the activity to the student that came in half an hour late. You did a great job incorporating the latecomer to your session - I wish he had come on time so you could have done the first activity with more than one student! Your checking for understanding at the end of the session was super strong as well.","I would encourage you to utilize wait time a little more! The girl that attended definitely seems to be used to getting answers right away, though she did catch on to you redirecting the questions haha. Don't be afraid to really use wait time to make students think a little deeper, or redirect them to their notes too (good job doing this in session). If you redirect students to their notes and they don't have many or any notes at all, it would be a great opportunity to chat with your students about study strategies and how they are taking notes!

Also, I noticed that in the second activity that you did, the student that came in late was a little lost. I know the point of the activity was for it to be a race, but in a situation like this where one student knows most of the information and another student doesn't, it might have been beneficial to pair them up and just have them work through the problem together. You did a great job of checking for understanding with the latecomer though - having him walk you back through the problem was perfect."

* Demonstrated facilitation skills beautifully when addressing a confused student: broke problems into manageable parts, redirected questions, and consistently checked for understanding. To really highlight one, check for understanding was done amazingly. 

* Created a welcoming and supportive environment where students felt comfortable and excited to participate.

* Kept the session highly student-centered, rarely holding the marker and allowing students to lead the activity.","* Very small, but consider keeping the door propped open before and during the start of the session to make it easier and less intimidating for students to enter.

* After an exam, opening with heavy content may feel overwhelming. Having a more lighthearted opening can be a good way for students to breathe and decompress after an exam. If you really want to do something content-based instead, a debrief or group discussion about the exam could provide a smoother transition before resuming content review.

* Incorporating more variety into activities could better address diverse learning styles. Simply doing base practice problems might not work for everyone. For example, intermixing graphs and exercises might help people who are more visual learn better and give them different strategies to tackle problems in place of pattern recognition. "

* Beginning with a brief discussion was a great way to gauge students’ needs and adjust the session accordingly.

","* Consider providing more redirection to the group rather than giving answers or first steps. Even with one student, rephrasing questions back (e.g., “What's your gut telling you?” and “Why do you think that?”) encourages critical thinking. Similarly, if a student finishes a problem and it's wrong, asking them to double-check or reflect before confirming or denying can be a helpful nudge.

* When a student arrived late, the SI gave them a separate problem. An alternative could be having the current student explain their thought process so far, or assigning different problems briefly before regrouping to share solutions (presentation style). This maintains collaboration while easing the transition.

* A small point: standing behind the podium and looking at your laptop at times created some distance during whiteboard problems. Sitting or standing with students may foster a more peer-friendly atmosphere."

,CHEM!!,Full observation,,,,Yes,Yes,SIL did a super fun Buzzfeed quiz for her opener!,"Group discussion, Clusters, Gallery Walk",Promoted collaboration,Yes,Yes,,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Strengths: For the first activity, SIL had 3 whiteboards up around the room full of questions that were a recap from previous sessions. She did a great job of bouncing between the groups and checking in with them. It also looked like she had the correct answers on her iPad as she was walking around, and I think that's super smart to have that material readily available if students have questions. The students collaborated really well together and SIL did a great job of encouraging that collaboration. She then checked for understanding and transitioned into new material effortlessly - I really loved the balance of focus between new and old material.

Improvements: I think that SIL's redirection could be a little stronger!

I'm being picky though because all other aspects of her session were so strong!",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,"Strengths: I read SIL's paperwork this semester, but haven't gotten the chance to observe a session of hers until now and I'm so glad I was able to! Her and SIL have a great dynamic throughout the session and the session environment is so welcoming. Although on the quieter side, SIL definitely takes control of the room and she was able to keep the students' attention span focused for the entirety of the session - I didn't see any students getting distracted or having side conversations. This is awesome! I also really enjoyed that SIL encouraged the students to read the questions carefully while they were practicing converting grams to moles and moles to grams. I really loved the cookie analogy that was given when they were reviewing limiting reagents. I think that no matter what content is being reviewed, a real life analogy can always help students understand the material better if they are struggling. 

Improvements: SIL had an idea about halfway through the session to switch up the groups of students a little bit and have them go up to the whiteboard instead of working with mini whiteboards at their table groups. I think this was a really great change to make based on how the session was going. I would have maybe liked to see this idea come from SIL instead, but honestly it's not that big of a deal because they are co-leads for a reason!! Sometimes all it takes to change the vibe of the session is to switch the groups up.

The SIL promoted collaboration by having the students sit together and work on problems. She also showed effective use of wait-time by walking away from the students after giving them the problems and giving them some time to work on their own. Also, by going over the topic with a brain dump before giving the students practice problems, the SIL made it easier for the students to actively recall things. This means they could rely on each other more and learning was student-centered. The use of ""on a scale of 1-5"" was a great way to end the first activity and ensure she knew where the students were, especially since you could see the students were understanding things during the problem solving. The SIL also did an amazing job of redirecting questions to the group to bring them closer to the answer before clearly explaining their mistake or the process to get the answer.

Areas of Improvement:
The majority of the session content focused on practice problems in clusters. This is a very good way to ensure the students are understanding the material, but it may also bore them and not show additional ways the students could study the material. It may also not work for students with different learning styles. The SIL could try to incorporate different kinds of activities.

* The students were clearly comfortable; they asked questions freely, and the session felt conversational. In fact, from the brain dump to the queue/stack implementation, it felt like the students were driving the conversation.

* The SI consistently checked for understanding through a variety of methods (drawing, coding smaller sections, discussing edge cases, and allowing the use of notes).

* Something small, but the SI made great use of conceptual connections, linking ADT to encapsulation and abstraction, which helped the student make meaningful connections between new and prior knowledge.

* Led the students through defining concepts, breaking them down, and rebuilding them in a logical way. ","* The SI could hone in on wait time and redirection a bit more. In particular, redirection could be implemented by bouncing one student's question to another. This not only encourages critical thinking but also encourages peer-to-peer discourse. 

* When a new student arrives late, consider integrating them by having the first student explain what’s been covered so far. This can build rapport, serve as a check for understanding, and reinforce the idea of it being a study group. 

* In moments when a question arises that you’re unsure about (e.g., the discussion around size_t), take advantage of redirection by prompting students to explore the concept further:

“What do you think size_t might be used for?”

“Why might the professor prefer this type?”

This helps adapt the session to their needs in real time and builds a comfortable, open environment.

* It’s clear that the students have great chemistry and feel at ease participating; they interact, chat, and flow between activities naturally. 

* The spotlight of the session was the use of the SI's facilitation strategies. In particular, the SI's use of wait time was unmatched. They consistently checked for understanding, prompting students to explain their reasoning, make their own definitions, and build on one another's ideas through thoughtful follow-up questions. The SI redirected questions back to students to instigate critical thinking or collaboration to figure out a problem.

* Preparation is evident, as well as overall time management.","There were a few moments when the SI stepped aside from the group for moderate stretches to prepare the next activity. While this worked well for this particular group, for others, it can be important to remain more closely involved with the students throughout the session. Staying engaged even during transitions allows you to observe group dynamics in real time and step in to prompt deeper discussion or introduce new challenges as needed. "

,MOPS!!,Full observation,,,,Yes,Yes,SIL taught her student how to juggle!! So much fun and the student actually caught on really well!,"Group discussion, Clusters, she only had 1 student so it was hard to gauge what CLTs were being used so I just guessed lol",Promoted collaboration,Somewhat,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Strengths: SIL did really well with all three pillars. Super strong wait time and checking for understanding, and she also made sure to redirect the student to his notes if he was confused. SIL also did a great job of simplifying some questions to help the student get to the answer when he was confused. She asked them in a different way, which sometimes can really help the students. This happened to me a lot when I was supporting photo tech - students wouldn't really understand what I was saying the first time around, and then I would try saying it a different way and it would make total sense to the students. 

Her slides were very cute - they were Spongebob themed! Doing little things like this helps make SI sessions more fun for students, especially if only a small amount show up. SIL effortlessly checked for understanding after each part of the code and the student seemed to leave the session feeling more confident in the material, from what I observed. 

Improvements: N/A! I know SIL has been doing a lot of marketing but she also told me that her B session time originally wasn't the one she wanted so she thinks that's why her attendance is lower for B sessions. I really think she is doing great for pretty much having a consistent one student almost every session; especially it being her first semester as a SIL too. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Strengths: I think this was a really solid session for only having one student. I know that SIL usually only has one student attend her sessions, and that her B sessions are usually no shows, but she does a great job of not letting it get to her. She didn't think that she was going to have anyone show up today, but her regular did and she was super excited! I was also excited as well because this is my first time observing her and I would hate for it to be a no show. SIL's opener (learn how to juggle) really set the tone for her session and it helped her and the student bond! The rest of her activities were great, though I wasn't too sure what CLTs were used because there was only 1 student present (my guess is probably just group discussion or clusters).

This class was extremely hard to get talking and the SI was very flexible and observant to more shy students, making sure to adjust their session as needed. From what I was told, they we're missing 2 students that create a much more extroverted dynamic so it was nice to see how adaptable they we're. 

 However, the SI could use some more focus on redirection and wait time. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,The SI created a great environment for the students to be in.

The SI as a whole was very personable and had a great rapport with the students. 

* Promoted collaboration between students. Demonstrated adaptability by noticing when a quieter student participated less and adjusting accordingly. For example, prompting the more shy student with objectives or allowing individual work, then re-grouping and discussing. 

* I was really impressed with the slides. When using slides, it can be easy to turn it into a lecture; the SI, on the other hand, used them more for active recall and checking for understanding (a slide is brief and vague, then has a student use active recall to explain it, then finally has students do an activity relating to the slide to check for understanding) 

* Moved throughout the room frequently to provide individualized support and assess understanding.","* Could benefit from incorporating more redirection. 

** Instead of directly confirming correctness, ask students to identify or explain their reasoning. The end goal is for students to discover mistakes naturally and correct them naturally to promote critical thinking. 

** With a group that size, it can be helpful to bounce a question around a few times instead of directly answering it. This helps check for understanding (from other students) and promotes collaboration. (don't be afraid of wait time)

* It was evident that this group was much harder to get to collaborate with each other, especially when in clusters. One alternative to this may be to have a much larger group discussion or to do an activity as a class instead. This allows the SI to act as a guide for the conversation. For example, you can bounce questions or ideas around, use wait time until someone speaks, or ask more shy students questions or prompt them to write something directly.

*  There were a few ""Does that make sense?"" moments. It can feel instinctual to ask this, but 9/10 times, a confused student will simply say yes. "

",5,bitwise operation examples (not enough time to get to Kahoot),"* The SI is very personable and builds strong connections with students, starting conversations and getting to know them individually.

* The inclusion of the facilitation strategies has improved much since I last observed a session. Wait time is excellent, allowing students to think through and articulate their ideas. The SI employs redirection skillfully, prompting students to work through questions together rather than providing immediate answers. 

* The SIs' opening (Chameleon) in particular was very creative, promoted collaboration, communication, and critical thinking in a lighthearted way (bonus points for taking the extra effort and creating your own website for it). 

* The SI involves students actively, having them work at the whiteboard, explain answers, and participate in engaging activities like races. They managed the classroom well, regrouping and clustering students when needed, and kept them engaged throughout.","These are a bit more nitpicky as there wasn't too much to comment on:

* It might have been easier for the students to grasp the content if there was more structure to the activities, especially if it's their first time with the concept. For example, with the unsigned and signed bits, it might have been helpful for them to do a few examples before jumping into more abstract concepts (for example, it wasn't clear if the students fully understood why 1's complement resulted in 2 zeros and why 2's complement solved this issue).

The SIL did a great job of ensuring the students were all working together by having them sit together and reminding them to discuss when things got silent. When students could not find an answer despite discussing with each other, the SIL had them work through an example/question which allowed them to reach the answer on their own (great use of redirecting/breaking down large concepts without re-lecturing). Instead of asking whether the students understood, he asked what questions they still had which takes the pressure of knowing things away. When students asked him questions, he asked other students if they understood or to help explain things (another point in the redirecting questions column). When students struggled to understand the concept, he led them through parts of it so that they knew enough to understand and then gave the board to the students and stepped away for them to start figuring out an answer. The Kahoot was a great way to check for understanding at the end. The activities had a good range of different study techniques including discussion, practice, and quizzing.
Areas of Improvement:
These are just a nitpick. When the students have questions and none can answer it, have them look at their resources like notes so that they remember how to make use of those while studying.

* The session was adaptable to different group sizes

Areas of Growth:
* The session could use a bit more variety in learning styles, as it seemed to be pretty heavy on code examples in place of conceptually understanding things.","Marketing:

General Marketing areas were touched on:

* the SI seems to be hitting the core requirements along with promoting sessions in other ways.

*  The idea of using the professor as a method of marketing was discussed, such as having them post announcements on myCourses or promote it during lecture. 

* Likewise, the SI could use a Google Form to collect ideas on why students may or may not be attending. Ways of getting the students to fill out the form were also brought up, such as making a reward for class percentage, putting exam survey questions on it, and having them rank SI activities to promote what happens during sessions.

Other Areas:

One key area that was touched on was how to incorporate a more verbose catalog of openings. 

In general, all classes are different, and some mesh with different types of openings; not all of them have to be personal, such as ""Highs and Lows"" or ""Fun Facts"". They can be simple online games such as LinkedIn mini games, Wordle, or GeoGuessr. If you want to get them out of their seats, you could do something like a whiteboard tier list (for example, have them make a marker color tier list with the markers themselves) or draw some squiggles on the board and have them turn them into an animal, such as birds. It's also completely okay for the opening to be content-based, but it should be fairly light and easy to get into (which your openings already seem to be). The main hope is to just get the students out of their seats and interacting/talking with each other. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Unsure,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,"The entire session was very student led, and even in a group this size the SI had students at the white board and writing down answers. Overall the session had a great atmosphere to be in and the SI was able to reasonably interact and reel in a group this social and of this size.  ",24,Kahoot / Exam reminders,"* The SI did a fantastic job promoting collaboration and group interaction both inside and outside the SI session, whether it be from the group worksheet, the use of GroupMe, or encouraging students to work with one another when confused.

* The SI kept the energy positive and productive throughout the session. Likewise, the SI was able to reel in the students when needed. 

* The SI was very observant and made sure to interact with each group during the cluster section, managing group dynamics and promoting students to figure out problems as a team instead of just seeking answers from them. 

* Used wait time strategically and made sure to hear from groups that have not spoken as much. 

* In particular, I loved the opening. It was fun, got the class moving around, thinking, talking, and took advantage of the size of the session.

* Something interesting was how the SI went beyond just exam reminders and tips, but included wellness-oriented tips such as eating breakfast, getting enough sleep, and staying relaxed before an exam. ","* The SI could incorporate some more redirection and checking for understanding into the session to fully grasp comprehension, as it was hard to tell if everyone fully understood some answers. For example, when (or after) having students write an answer on the board, have another student explain the answer. Likewise, throw them a curveball and change the question slightly to see if they fully understand it. 

* While it can be tempting to get a group consensus around understanding, with a group this size, someone is bound to lie or undermine their lack of understanding. So, taking the time to pause and have students summarize key takeaways or misconceptions could ensure everyone stays on track.

* I would have loved to see a bit more redirection, with a group this size and as talkative as they are, having the ability to bounce a question around the room or get different perspectives/phrasings is almost a superpower. "

I understand wanting the students to struggle a little bit on the practice problems, but make sure that you keep them relatively on track by not letting their mistakes go unchecked. Make sure that your sessions are a safe space for all students, and that there's no slandering of other students or professors happening.

,MATH - 101,"Coaching session (i.e., no students have shown up in the first 15 minutes)","Marketing that works well for you vs what they're trying, Strategies to connect with students, Talk about what their session plan was and provide feedback (positive and constructive), How to collaborate with their professor to promote SI, Collaborating with professor to gain ideas for their session, Weekly emails","* The SI has a great understanding of the SI model and its nuanced details. His session promoted collaboration, had the students at the whiteboard, and was adaptable to the number of students and the students' needs.

* Used a variety of learning strategies (round robin, clusters, group discussion).

* Something small but helpful in the learning process is having the students move around and not be stationary, which the SI seems to have baked into his session. I find that when students move around, they tend to be more engaged, communicative, and more accepting of the SI model. 

* Likewise, the SI's session flows from one activity to another. The round robin gives them time to think, the mind-map allows them to cluster their ideas and think on a conceptual level, and then finally, the practice groups use the mind map as the template for problems.","Marketing:

Overall, the SI is doing a great job here. They are reaching out to other SIs, and with the SI team, they're professor is very helpful. They are going above and beyond for marketing. They tried punch cards, candy, mock SI sessions in class, merged sessions, in-class marketing, and the professor has also been promoting it via widgets and spoken announcements. Unfortunately, I believe this happens to be more of an overall class issue and has nothing to do with the SI. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,GCIS - 123,Full observation,,,,Yes,No,Big O cheatsheet ,Group discussion,Promoted collaboration,Somewhat,Somewhat,Yes,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,Yes,No,Yes,"The SI used wait time and redirection well. But could most definitely improve on check for understanding. It was hard to fully grasp if the student knew and understood the ""why"".

",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Nothing too negative here. The SI was respectful and created a relaxed environment to be in.  They also revealed stories and were very personable with the student. ,1,Time complexity review of quicksort,"* Student-centered facilitation: The SI consistently used wait time and guided questioning to help the student discover answers on their own, promoting critical thinking. 

* Breaking problems into manageable parts: The SI did an excellent job scaffolding complex topics like recursion and Big-O by having the student tackle one piece at a time before recombining them into the full solution.

* Active recall integration: The opener with the Big-O cheatsheet was a great way to re-engage prior knowledge. It also physically brought the student up to the board, encouraging active participation.

* Productive dialogue: The session maintained a conversational tone, which always helps strengthen that SI-student dynamic. ","* Clarify conceptual understanding early on: At times, it was difficult to tell whether the student fully understood Big-O or was recalling memorized facts. Consider having them define key terms first, then use examples to reinforce understanding.

* Conceptual Guidance: From my experience, it can be challenging to have students jump right into code. It might help the student more if they first start with more conceptual understanding before jumping into technical. For example, it was unclear if the student fully understood quicksort while coding it. Having them define the process and then drawing out an example promotes both check for understanding and incorporates multiple learning strategies. 

* Enhance facilitation strategies: Certain facilitation strategies could be honed a bit. For example, checking for understanding seemed a bit lacking. Having the student explain their code aloud or predict outcomes can make their reasoning clearer. 

* No agenda: While it's something small, having an agenda on the board can help late comers integrate into the session or even allow students in general to keep track of how the session is progressing. "

You did a great job of using wait-time in letting the students without your input until they were done and redirecting questions by asking questions that forced them to go through what their code would do line-by-line instead to check they understood what they wrote.

You did a great job checking for their understanding by asking them related questions after checking that their code was correct to ensure they completely understood what they need to do AND why they need to do things in that way.
Areas of Improvement:
This is more of a nitpick. When you ask a group questions, direct some of those questions to specific people so that everyone can show they understand and have a chance to answer.

* When students answer a question, ask them to explain or write out their reasoning, whether correct or not, to help check for understanding.

*  It seemed the student was having some trouble during the coding portion. Perhaps try first letting them run through the algorithm from a higher conceptual view. For example, first have the student define what the algorithm is, then run through an example. This can help transition them from the concept to the technical details and provide a variety of learning methods.
